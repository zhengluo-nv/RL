# Chaos variant of grpo_dp_single_controller.sh: SIGKILL a vLLM generation worker
# mid-run and assert the job fails fast and loudly instead of wedging.
#
# This is the scenario the whole SC resiliency effort exists for. Before the P0
# work, a dead generation endpoint left rollouts parked forever -- each holding a
# max_inflight_prompts permit -- until the rollout pump blocked and the train pump
# spun, with no exception raised anywhere. The pass condition here is therefore not
# "training succeeds"; it is "the job stops, quickly, with an attributable error".
#
# Registered in the SingleController L1 lane (full mode). It was originally kept out as
# "timing-sensitive", but that no longer justifies exclusion: the death deadline is now
# 600s against an observed 222s, and the victim selection is asserted rather than assumed.
# (The shard-recovery harness added in part 3/4 of this series kills processes the same
# way, from the same lane.) Leaving it out meant
# the containment behaviour had no end-to-end coverage at all -- and a wedge is precisely
# the failure that no other test can detect, because it raises nothing.
#
# Usage: bash tests/functional/grpo_dp_single_controller_chaos.sh

# How long to wait for the job to die after the kill. The point of the test is that

# 600s, not 300s: an observed run took 222s to die (5 re-dispatch attempts with capped
# exponential backoff, which is the designed containment behaviour). 300s left only 26%
# headroom, and CI is slower than this workstation -- a deadline that tight turns into a

DEATH_DEADLINE_S=${DEATH_DEADLINE_S:-600}
# Which generation worker to kill, and in which state.
#
# Ray retitles a worker with setproctitle for the exact duration of a call, so a single
# actor cycles through several titles. Observed over one run (378 samples):
#
#   /opt/ray_venvs/...VllmAsyncGenerationWorker/bin/python   a CHILD process, not the actor
#   bash -c exec /opt/ray_venvs/...GenerationWorker...       the launcher shell
#   ray::VllmAsyncGenerationWorker                           the actor, between calls
#   ray::vllm_policy-0-0:VllmAsyncGenerationWorker.__init__  the actor, constructing
#   ray::VllmAsyncGenerationWorker.generate_async            the actor, serving a rollout
#   ray::VllmAsyncGenerationWorker.init_collective_async     the actor, setting up refit
#   ray::VllmAsyncGenerationWorker.shutdown                  the actor, tearing down
#
# A loose `[Gg]enerationWorker` substring matches every one of those -- three distinct
# processes across five states -- and `head -1` then picked whichever had the lowest pid.
# So the test silently chose a different scenario from run to run. It never failed, because
# every scenario does end in a bounded attributable failure, which is all it asserted; the
# difference only showed up as wildly different wall-clock times across branches (7s vs
# 222s). A `*GenerationWorker*` check on the victim does not help either: the launcher
# shell and the venv child both satisfy it.
#
# So select the ACTOR structurally (`ray::` prefix, optional `name:` infix) and pin the
# state:
#   idle    -- title has no method suffix. Nothing is in flight, so the loss must be
#              *detected*: by a health probe, or by the stall detector. This exercises the
#              resiliency machinery, so it is the default.
#   serving -- title is `.generate_async`. An in-flight rollout RPC dies with the worker
#              and the failure surfaces immediately, without detection doing any work.
#
# Deliberately not "any method suffix": killing during __init__, init_collective_async or
# shutdown are three further distinct scenarios, and lumping them in would reintroduce
# exactly the ambiguity this replaces.
VICTIM_STATE=${VICTIM_STATE:-idle}
# How long to wait for the worker to be observed in that state. Generous because `serving`
# is a narrow window -- generate_async was only ~2% of samples, against ~34% for idle.
VICTIM_WAIT_S=${VICTIM_WAIT_S:-300}
# Separate budget for finding the actors at all, before any state is considered.
# Generation takes a while to come up, and conflating the two made 'no actors' and
# 'actors never reached the state' indistinguishable in the log.
ACTOR_WAIT_S=${ACTOR_WAIT_S:-300}

# that is itself unwell hangs the harness rather than the run it is watching.

# just `time "$@"` -- so a single sample reads the previous test's corpse. That is exactly
# what broke GitHub CI: chaos-idle passed at 19:51:42, its cleanup killed the
# VLLM::EngineCore it had orphaned on purpose, and chaos-serving sampled 280ms later,
# found GPU 0 still holding 50470MiB, and refused to start without running a single line
# of product code. It had always passed on the cluster only because submit-ci.sh sleeps 5s
