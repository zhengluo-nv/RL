"""RDMA buffer-registration bookkeeping for the mooncake staging pool.

Every failure guarded here reaches production as the same symptom — mooncake's
generic ``TRANSFER_FAIL`` (-800) out of ``batch_upsert_from``, carrying no root
cause and often on keys the pool never touched, because the damage is to
address-level registration state shared with the unpatched byte paths. None of
it needs an RDMA device to reproduce: the pool's contract is with
``register_buffer`` / ``unregister_buffer``, so a recording double is enough.
