"""Shared TQ data-plane client fixtures.

Mooncake's C++ engine keeps a process-global mount registry that survives
Python-level ``close()`` (upstream ``transfer_queue.close()`` also leaves
``mooncake_master`` running). Re-initializing the client in the same
pytest worker process leaks stale segment endpoints; the next
``batch_upsert_from`` then routes to a dead endpoint from a prior init
and returns ``TRANSFER_FAIL`` (-800). Production never hits this — the
driver bootstraps once and workers attach via ``bootstrap=False``.

Session-scoping the underlying clients here mirrors production: exactly
one mooncake init per pytest worker, period. Tests must use distinct
``partition_id`` values (seqpack-eq / dynbatch-eq / nopack-eq /
smoke / smoke-backend / smoke-1d / obj-backend / mix-e2e today).
