"""The initial Gym payload must honour pad_dynamic_image_shapes.

This path only runs when ``grpo.deduplicate_multimodal_data`` is true: the
driver attaches the prompt's image tensors once, before
``repeat_interleave(..., share_immutable_media=True)`` fans the prompt out. The
per-turn attach inside the NeMo-Gym actor already reads the flag, so without it
here the same prompt is processed under different rules on the two paths.

It bites only for a prompt carrying more than one image at differing
resolutions, which is exactly what a dynamic-resolution processor returns as a
ragged CHW list.
