"""Weight synchronization interface for NeMo-RL.

WeightSynchronizer is a dedicated abstraction that decouples weight transfer
logic from both PolicyInterface and GenerationInterface. It owns the
transfer of model weights between training and generation components.

Transport-specific implementations (IPC/ZMQ, HTTP, NCCL collectives, checkpoint
engines) each
encapsulate the transfer lifecycle, so algorithm code never branches on
backend type.

Colocated transports (IPC, HTTP) own GPU phase transitions internally
(offload, prepare_for_generation, restore) as part of their sync_weights()
implementation. The NCCL collective transport is a pure data mover; the
orchestrator handles phase transitions externally since policy and
generation run on separate GPU clusters.

This interface assumes **global weight updates**: all generation workers
are updated atomically and are always at the same weight version. Per-worker
updates (where different replicas could be at different versions) are not
supported. In async GRPO, heterogeneous weight ages are handled at the
sample level (via replay buffer ``target_weight_versions`` tracking), not
at the synchronizer level.

    whether components are colocated; per-step staleness bookkeeping is
    owned by the training loop.

        This method encapsulates the full sync lifecycle:

        4. Verify the transfer succeeded
        5. Restore both sides to their ready state

        Steps 1-2 and 5 (phase transitions) are only performed by colocated
        transports (IPC, HTTP). Non-colocated collective and checkpoint-engine
        transports skip them since policy and generation run on separate GPUs.

        Step 4 (verification) is performed explicitly by IPC and NCCL
        transports, which check ``update_success`` and raise on failure. The
        HTTP transport relies on ``ray.get()`` to propagate any server-side
        errors (matching the existing grpo.py behavior).
