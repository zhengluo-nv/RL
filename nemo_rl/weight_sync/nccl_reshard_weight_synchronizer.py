"""NCCL-xfer (shard-to-shard) weight synchronizer for non-colocated deployments.

Handles disaggregated Megatron-train -> vLLM-gen weight refit via the
``xferdtensor`` reshard: bulk FFN/expert params are resharded shard-to-shard
between the train and gen parallelism layouts over a dedicated per-PP-stage NCCL
communicator, while the remaining "misc" params ride a packed broadcast over the
shared ``model_update_group``. Unlike the plain collective synchronizer (which
broadcasts every full tensor), this path redistributes each param directly
between layouts, avoiding a full gather + broadcast.

Lifecycle:
  init_communicator():
    1. policy/generation.init_collective()           -- model_update_group (misc)
    2. policy/generation.init_nccl_reshard_comm_group()  -- per-PP-stage bulk groups
    3. policy.prepare_nccl_reshard_refit_info()
       -> generation.prepare_nccl_reshard_refit_info()   -- backend-agnostic metadata
  sync_weights():
    policy.nccl_reshard_refit(kv_scales) + generation.nccl_reshard_refit(); verify.

Like the collective transport, this is a pure data mover: policy and generation
run on separate GPU clusters, so the phase transitions (offload / restore) are
owned by the orchestrator, not here.
