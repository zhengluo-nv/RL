This is a work around to ensure whenever NeMo RL is imported, that we
add Megatron-LM to the python path. The editable install of megatron-core
only exposes the packages declared in Megatron-LM's pyproject.toml
(megatron.core and megatron.training), but megatron.training lazily imports
megatron.{legacy,post_training} in some code paths (e.g., loading old fp16
checkpoints, detecting modelopt state for quantization-aware flows). Adding
the whole repo to the path makes megatron.{legacy,inference,post_training,...}
importable too.

Since users may pip install NeMo RL, this is a convenience so they do not
have to manually run with PYTHONPATH=3rdparty/Megatron-Bridge-workspace/Megatron-Bridge/3rdparty/Megatron-LM.
