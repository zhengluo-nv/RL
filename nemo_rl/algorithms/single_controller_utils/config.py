    the native/NeMo-Gym split, so they govern **both** paths. Everything path-specific
    lives in the ``native`` and ``nemo_gym`` sub-blocks, so the structure itself says
    which knob applies where -- these used to dangle on ``async_rl`` among unrelated
    pump and buffer settings, where a native-path operator could set the most
    generic-sounding one (``rollout_timeout_s``) and silently get no deadline at all.

    Infrastructure failures re-dispatch the prompt onto a different generation shard;
    data failures are deterministic, so their budget is small and exhausting it is
    reported rather than absorbed. Nothing here ever discards a prompt silently.

    Each class also has a budget for how many prompts may be given up on entirely, and
    the two differ because the question they answer differs. Data exhaustion is a
    property of the dataset, so ``max_skipped_prompts`` counts them for the run's
    lifetime. Infra exhaustion is a property of the fleet at a moment in time, so
    ``max_consecutive_dropped_prompts`` resets on every success: an outage that ends is
    absorbed, one that does not stops the run.

    Once a prompt has been given up on, ``on_dropped_prompt`` decides what happens to
    the training step it was stamped for: train the step on fewer groups, or substitute
    a fresh prompt so the step keeps its configured batch size.
