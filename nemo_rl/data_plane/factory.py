    call sites. Raises if data_plane is disabled — the legacy trainer
    (``nemo_rl.algorithms.grpo.grpo_train``) should be used in that case
    rather than a NoOp fallback here.

    Args:
        cfg: Data-plane config; must have ``enabled=True``.
        bootstrap: ``True`` on the driver — bootstraps the TQ
            controller. ``False`` on worker processes — connects to the
            existing controller (avoids creating a second named actor).

        :class:`MetricsDataPlaneClient` when observability is enabled.
