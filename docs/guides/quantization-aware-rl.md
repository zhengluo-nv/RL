# Quantization-Aware RL (QARL)

Quantization-Aware RL (QARL) integrates [NVIDIA Model Optimizer (ModelOpt)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer) into the NeMo RL training loop, enabling quantization-aware training and generation for both GRPO and on-policy distillation workflows. QARL automatically quantizes a standard model at initialization, maintains quantizer state (amax values) throughout training, and transfers quantized state to vLLM during weight refit. By default, vLLM generation uses fake-quantized modules. For NVFP4 W4A4 and W4A16 rollout experiments, NeMo RL can instead stream packed real-quant ModelOpt NVFP4 weights and scales into vLLM.

## Overview

In a standard NeMo RL loop, model weights are trained in full precision and refitted into vLLM for generation. QARL applies quantization-aware modules so that both the policy forward pass and rollout generation exercise quantized weights and, depending on the recipe, quantized activations. The policy backward pass remains in full precision, using the straight-through estimator to propagate gradients through the quantization nodes.

There are two vLLM rollout modes:

- **Fake-quant rollout**: vLLM receives folded full-precision weights and runs fake-quantized layers. This is the default when `policy.generation.quant_cfg` is set.
- **Real-quant rollout**: vLLM is initialized with ModelOpt NVFP4 kernels and receives packed NVFP4 weights plus scale tensors during every refit. Enable this with `policy.generation.real_quant: true`. W4A16 keeps activations in their native dtype; W4A4 additionally streams calibrated activation scales and uses an activation-quantizing vLLM kernel. The Megatron policy worker exports the payload through Megatron-Bridge.

See [Verified Configurations](#verified-configurations) for the workflow + recipe combinations that have been empirically validated, and [Supported Quantization Formats](#supported-quantization-formats) for the full set of available formats. Results are recipe- and model-specific: the generic W4A4 `NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG` has known GRPO convergence issues, while the routed-expert Qwen3 W4A4 real-quant recipe below completed the documented single-seed campaign.

## Verified Configurations

The following workflow + quantization recipe combinations have been validated end-to-end (Megatron training + NVFP4-quantized vLLM generation + held-out validation):

| Workflow | Quantization | Recipe | Status | Example Config |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| QA-Distillation | W4A4 | `NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG` (NVFP4 weights + NVFP4 activations) | ✅ Converges | `examples/modelopt/qa_distillation_math_megatron.yaml` |
| QA-GRPO | W4A16 | `examples/modelopt/quant_configs/nvfp4_a16.yaml` (NVFP4 weights, native-dtype activations) | ✅ Converges | `examples/modelopt/qa_grpo_llama8b_megatron.v2.yaml` |
| QA-GRPO | W4A4 | `NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG` | ⚠️ Known convergence issue | `examples/modelopt/qa_grpo_math_megatron.yaml` |
| QA-Distillation | W4A4 | `examples/modelopt/quant_configs/nano3_nvfp4_default.yaml` | ✅ Converges | `examples/modelopt/qa_distillation_nano3_megatron.yaml` |
| QA-GRPO | W4A16 | `NVFP4_MLP_WEIGHT_ONLY_CFG` | ✅ Smoke tested on MoE | `examples/modelopt/qa_grpo_qwen3_30ba3b_megatron.yaml` |
| QA-GRPO real quantization rollout | W4A16 | `examples/modelopt/quant_configs/nvfp4_a16_mlp_only.yaml` with `policy.generation.real_quant: true` | ✅ Converges | `examples/configs/recipes/llm/grpo-qwen3-8b-base-dapo-2n8g-long-megatron-qa-nvfp4-w4a16.yaml` |
| QA-GRPO real quantization rollout | W4A16 | `examples/modelopt/quant_configs/nano3_nvfp4_weightonly.yaml` with `policy.generation.real_quant: true` and the model-specific `policy.generation.real_quant_ignore` list in the example | ✅ Converges tested on hybrid MoE/Mamba | `examples/configs/recipes/llm/grpo-nanov3-30ba3b-4n4g-megatron-qa-nvfp4-w4a16-real.yaml` |
| QA-GRPO real quantization rollout | W4A4 | `examples/modelopt/quant_configs/nvfp4_experts.yaml` with `policy.generation.real_quant: true` | ✅ Completed one 300-step Qwen3-30B-A3B MoE run | `examples/configs/recipes/llm/grpo-qwen3-30ba3b-4n4g-megatron-qa-nvfp4-w4a4-real.yaml` |

The `nvfp4_a16.yaml` custom YAML enables NVFP4 e2m1 weight quantization (with dynamic e4m3 micro-block scales) and leaves activations unquantized; weights are still exercised through both Megatron training and vLLM generation. The `nvfp4_a16_mlp_only.yaml` recipe restricts W4A16 to MLP weights for real-quant rollout. The Nano3 `nano3_nvfp4_weightonly.yaml` recipe applies the same W4A16 weight-only format to the supported MLP/MoE weights while keeping Nano3-sensitive Mamba, attention, gate/router, shared-expert, norm, and selected layer paths in BF16 through the model-specific `real_quant_ignore` list in the example config.

## Simulated KV-Cache Quantization

QARL can apply ModelOpt fake quantization to the attention K/V tensors in both
the Megatron policy and the vLLM rollout model. Use the same quantization recipe
for both workers so calibrated K/V amax values from the policy can be
transferred to matching rollout quantizers during refit. The only supported
exception is rollout-only FP8 K/V fake quantization with
`use_constant_amax: true`; vLLM computes the constant amax locally, so no
policy-side K/V quantization or amax transfer is required.

```yaml
policy:
  quant_cfg: /absolute/path/to/examples/modelopt/quant_configs/kv_cache_fp8.yaml

  generation:
    backend: vllm
    quant_cfg: /absolute/path/to/examples/modelopt/quant_configs/kv_cache_fp8.yaml
```

The KV-only examples are:

- `kv_cache_fp8.yaml`: FP8 E4M3 K/V fake quantization with constant amax.
- `kv_cache_nvfp4.yaml`: calibrated NVFP4 K/V fake quantization with dynamic
  per-block scales and a calibrated global amax.

NVFP4 K/V quantization has shown training-quality degradation in current
experiments. It is intended for studying QARL-based recovery of PTQ accuracy
and alternative recipes, including mixed formats and quantizing K/V in only
selected layers.

These recipes enable only the attention K/V quantizers, isolating K/V fake
quantization from weight and other activation quantization. To combine K/V
quantization with other formats, define all required quantizers in a single
recipe.

This path does not enable vLLM's native FP8 KV-cache storage. Set neither
`policy.generation.real_quant` nor a native vLLM KV-cache dtype for these
simulated recipes.

## ModelOpt Layer Spec Toggle

For QARL configs, try setting `policy.disable_modelopt_layer_spec=true` first.
This keeps ModelOpt quantization enabled while using the standard Megatron layer
specs instead of ModelOpt's custom layer specs. This is usually faster and works
for most models, but it is not guaranteed for every architecture or recipe. If
you encounter errors with the standard Megatron layer specs, leave it unset or
set it to `false` to exercise ModelOpt's Megatron layer-spec path.

## Quantization-Aware GRPO (QA-GRPO)

### Configuration

The QA-GRPO config extends the standard Megatron GRPO config by adding quantization parameters. See [Verified Configurations](#verified-configurations) for the status of W4A4 vs W4A16 on GRPO.

```yaml
# examples/modelopt/qa_grpo_llama8b_megatron.v2.yaml
defaults: "../configs/grpo_math_8B_megatron.yaml"

policy:
  quant_cfg: "examples/modelopt/quant_configs/nvfp4_a16.yaml"
  quant_calib_data: "cnn_dailymail"
  quant_calib_size: 512
  quant_batch_size: 1
  quant_sequence_length: 2048

  generation:
    quant_cfg: "examples/modelopt/quant_configs/nvfp4_a16.yaml"
```

### Running QA-GRPO

**Single node (8 GPUs):**

```bash
uv run examples/run_grpo.py \
  --config examples/modelopt/qa_grpo_llama8b_megatron.v2.yaml \
  policy.model_name=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
```

**Via Slurm:**

```bash
COMMAND="uv run examples/run_grpo.py \
  --config examples/modelopt/qa_grpo_llama8b_megatron.v2.yaml \
  policy.model_name=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
  checkpointing.checkpoint_dir=results/qa_grpo" \
CONTAINER=YOUR_CONTAINER \
MOUNTS="$PWD:$PWD" \
sbatch \
    --nodes=1 \
    --account=YOUR_ACCOUNT \
    --job-name=qa-grpo \
    --partition=YOUR_PARTITION \
    --time=4:0:0 \
    --gres=gpu:8 \
    ray.sub
```

## Real-Quant NVFP4 Rollout (W4A4 and W4A16)

Real-quant rollout is intended for checking the deployment-style vLLM path during RL, not only the fake-quant training path. With `policy.generation.real_quant: true`, the Megatron policy worker exports ModelOpt QAT weights through Megatron-Bridge as packed NVFP4 tensors during refit, and the vLLM worker loads them into ModelOpt NVFP4 layers. This exercises vLLM's real FP4 kernel path during rollout while the policy training worker remains a QAT model.

The W4A16 recipes below are validated configurations. W4A4 uses the same refit path plus calibrated per-layer or per-expert activation scales. The Megatron Qwen3 MoE recipe below completed one end-to-end 300-step run. Dense models can use the default real-quant ignore profile. MoE and hybrid models should use a model-specific ignore profile so unsupported or numerically sensitive paths stay in BF16.

### Minimal Configuration

Start from a Megatron GRPO config and add the ModelOpt weight-only recipe to both the policy and generation sections:

```yaml
policy:
  quant_cfg: examples/modelopt/quant_configs/nvfp4_a16_mlp_only.yaml

  generation:
    backend: vllm
    quant_cfg: examples/modelopt/quant_configs/nvfp4_a16_mlp_only.yaml
    real_quant: true
```

For routed-expert Qwen3 MoE W4A4, use the block-16 E2M1 recipe in both sections:

```yaml
policy:
  quant_cfg: examples/modelopt/quant_configs/nvfp4_experts.yaml

  generation:
    backend: vllm
    quant_cfg: examples/modelopt/quant_configs/nvfp4_experts.yaml
    real_quant: true
```

NeMo RL derives W4A4 versus W4A16 from the effective ModelOpt quantizer formats and rejects a policy/generation mode mismatch. W4A4 requires a native activation-quantizing NVFP4 backend; the weight-only Marlin path is reserved for W4A16. Fused-MoE real-quant refits currently require every vLLM rank to own the full expert set.

For Nano3 W4A16 real-quant rollout, use the Nano3 weight-only recipe and an explicit model-specific ignore list:

```yaml
policy:
  quant_cfg: examples/modelopt/quant_configs/nano3_nvfp4_weightonly.yaml

  generation:
    backend: vllm
    quant_cfg: examples/modelopt/quant_configs/nano3_nvfp4_weightonly.yaml
    real_quant: true
    real_quant_ignore:
      - lm_head
      - '*output_layer*'
      - '*mlp.gate'
      - '*router*'
      - '*block_sparse_moe.gate*'
      - '*self_attention*'
      - '*self_attn*'
      - '*proj_out.*'
      - '*.gate.*'
      - '*mlp.shared_expert_gate.*'
      - '*linear_attn.conv1d*'
      - '*mixer.conv1d*'
      - '*.mixer.in_proj*'
      - '*.mixer.out_proj*'
      - '*.shared_expert.*'
      - '*.shared_experts.*'
      - '*.norm.*'
      - '*.q_proj*'
      - '*.k_proj*'
      - '*.v_proj*'
      - '*.o_proj*'
      - '*.qkv_proj*'
      - '*.linear_proj*'
      - '*.linear_qkv*'
      - '*.layers.4.*'
      - '*.layers.11.*'
      - '*.layers.18.*'
      - '*.layers.25.*'
      - '*.layers.32.*'
      - '*.layers.41.*'
    vllm_cfg:
      gpu_memory_utilization: 0.35
      enable_prefix_caching: false
```

The ready-to-run 2-node DAPO long-context recipe is:

```text
examples/configs/recipes/llm/grpo-qwen3-8b-base-dapo-2n8g-long-megatron-qa-nvfp4-w4a16.yaml
```

The ready-to-run Nano3 4-node x 4-GPU smoke recipe is:

```text
examples/configs/recipes/llm/grpo-nanov3-30ba3b-4n4g-megatron-qa-nvfp4-w4a16-real.yaml
```

The Qwen3-30B-A3B W4A4 real-quant recipe is:

```text
examples/configs/recipes/llm/grpo-qwen3-30ba3b-4n4g-megatron-qa-nvfp4-w4a4-real.yaml
```

This recipe contains the 300-step, 256-example-validation campaign settings.
The GB200 nightly driver overrides it to a two-step, 32-example smoke test.
Both paths require the standalone ModelOpt-enabled Megatron-Bridge checkout;
the embedded NeMo RL checkout does not contain the grouped-MoE W4A4 exporter.

For a BF16 baseline, copy the recipe, remove `policy.quant_cfg`,
`policy.generation.quant_cfg`, and `policy.generation.real_quant`, and use distinct
checkpoint and log directories.

### Running the Example

From the repository root inside the NeMo RL container:

```bash
uv run --extra mcore --extra modelopt --extra vllm \
  examples/run_grpo.py \
  --config examples/configs/recipes/llm/grpo-qwen3-8b-base-dapo-2n8g-long-megatron-qa-nvfp4-w4a16.yaml
```

For Nano3:

```bash
uv run --extra mcore --extra modelopt --extra vllm \
  examples/run_grpo.py \
  --config examples/configs/recipes/llm/grpo-nanov3-30ba3b-4n4g-megatron-qa-nvfp4-w4a16-real.yaml
```

For Qwen3 MoE W4A4:

```bash
uv run --extra mcore --extra modelopt --extra vllm \
  examples/run_grpo.py \
  --config examples/configs/recipes/llm/grpo-qwen3-30ba3b-4n4g-megatron-qa-nvfp4-w4a4-real.yaml
```

For Slurm, wrap the same command in `ray.sub` as shown in [Running QA-GRPO](#running-qa-grpo). Keep each quantized and BF16 comparison arm separate and use distinct checkpoint directories.

### Checkpoints and Fresh Starts

For a clean first-step comparison, use a new, empty `checkpointing.checkpoint_dir`; NeMo RL resumes automatically from the highest `step_*` directory it finds. The Megatron policy path also uses a converted startup checkpoint, so move aside both the training checkpoint and the converted Megatron checkpoint before launching:

```bash
# Training checkpoint: matches `checkpointing.checkpoint_dir` in your config.
mv checkpoints/grpo-qwen3-8b-base-dapo-2n-long-w4a16 checkpoints/grpo-qwen3-8b-base-dapo-2n-long-w4a16.old

# Converted Megatron checkpoint: under `$NRL_MEGATRON_CHECKPOINT_DIR` if set,
# else `$HF_HOME/nemo_rl` or `~/.cache/huggingface/nemo_rl`. The subdirectory is
# named after the HF model; see "Megatron Checkpoint Directory" below.
MEGATRON_CKPT_ROOT="${NRL_MEGATRON_CHECKPOINT_DIR:-${HF_HOME:-$HOME/.cache/huggingface}/nemo_rl}"
mv "$MEGATRON_CKPT_ROOT/<hf-model-subdir>" "$MEGATRON_CKPT_ROOT/<hf-model-subdir>.old"
```

If `NRL_MEGATRON_CHECKPOINT_DIR` is set, move aside the subdirectory used by the run. On first startup, the log should show that iteration 0 was saved or loaded from a freshly generated conversion checkpoint.

For long runs on queues with short wall times, enable periodic checkpointing and submit dependency jobs with `afterany` so the next job can resume from the checkpoint written by the previous job.

### Log Checks

A healthy W4A16 real-rollout run should include these lines or equivalent vLLM logs:

```text
quantization=modelopt
Detected ModelOpt NVFP4 checkpoint
Using NvFp4LinearBackend.MARLIN for NVFP4 GEMM
MegatronQuantPolicyWorker[rank=0]: Packed ... groups of tensors
```

A W4A4 run should show the same ModelOpt checkpoint/refit signals but must not select `NvFp4LinearBackend.MARLIN`; NeMo RL rejects that weight-only backend because it would leave activations unquantized.

It should not include:

```text
Using rollout logprobs
negative scales
CUDA error: invalid argument
```

For an initial sanity check, compare the first `Generation KL Error` with the BF16 baseline. They should be close on step 1. A substantially larger W4A16 first-step KL usually means the rollout model does not match the policy model, the run reused a stale checkpoint, or the real-quant export/refit path did not load the expected tensors.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| vLLM does not log `quantization=modelopt` | `policy.generation.real_quant` is not set or generation is not using vLLM | Check the YAML under `policy.generation` |
| `Using rollout logprobs` appears | The run is bypassing policy/reference logprob computation | Do not use rollout logprobs for real-quant validation |
| First-step W4A16 `Generation KL Error` is much higher than BF16 | Stale resume state, a stale converted Megatron checkpoint on the Megatron path, or a refit/export mismatch | Use a fresh training checkpoint directory; on Megatron also move aside the converted startup checkpoint; confirm packed tensors are streamed |
| `negative scales` warning appears | Invalid or stale NVFP4 scale tensors reached vLLM | Use a fresh checkpoint directory and verify the same supported NVFP4 recipe is used for both policy and generation |
| Nano3 first-step KL is high while dense W4A16 is healthy | Nano3-sensitive paths were quantized or the vLLM ignore set does not match the policy recipe | Use `nano3_nvfp4_weightonly.yaml` for policy and generation, and copy the explicit `policy.generation.real_quant_ignore` list from the Nano3 example recipe |
| CUDA invalid argument during refit or generation | vLLM consumed malformed packed tensors or stale IPC state | Restart from a fresh job and inspect the first real-quant refit logs |

## Quantization-Aware Distillation (On-Policy QAD)

QAD combines on-policy distillation with quantization. The student model is quantized while the teacher remains in full precision, allowing the student to recover accuracy lost from quantization through knowledge distillation.

### Configuration

```yaml
# examples/modelopt/qa_distillation_math_megatron.yaml
defaults: "../configs/distillation_math_megatron.yaml"

policy:
    quant_cfg: "NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG"
    quant_calib_data: "cnn_dailymail"
    quant_calib_size: 512
    quant_batch_size: 1
    quant_sequence_length: 2048

    generation:
        quant_cfg: "NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG"
```

### Running QAD

```bash
uv run examples/run_distillation.py \
  --config examples/modelopt/qa_distillation_math_megatron.yaml \
  policy.model_name=Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B \
  teacher.model_name=Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B
```

## Quantization Parameters

These parameters are added under the `policy` section:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `quant_cfg` | Quantization config. Accepts: a built-in ModelOpt config name (e.g. `"NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG"`), a built-in ModelOpt PTQ recipe name (e.g. `"general/ptq/nvfp4_default-fp8_kv"`, suffix optional), or the path to a custom YAML recipe (e.g. `"examples/modelopt/quant_configs/nvfp4_a16.yaml"`). Use absolute paths for user-authored recipes in Ray/container workers. See `examples/modelopt/quant_configs/` for an example and `modelopt_recipes/general/ptq/` in Model-Optimizer for the canonical YAML format. |
| `quant_calib_data` | Dataset name used for calibration. See the [ModelOpt PTQ examples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/llm_ptq) for supported datasets. |
| `quant_calib_size` | Number of samples for the calibration pass |
| `quant_batch_size` | Batch size during calibration |
| `quant_sequence_length` | Sequence length for calibration data |

The `policy.generation.quant_cfg` should match `policy.quant_cfg` to ensure consistent quantization between training and generation.

Generation-specific parameters are added under `policy.generation`:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `quant_cfg` | Quantization config used by the vLLM generation worker. For QARL, this should normally match `policy.quant_cfg`. |
| `real_quant` | When `true`, vLLM uses ModelOpt NVFP4 real kernels and receives packed quantized weights during refit. The effective `quant_cfg` selects W4A4 or W4A16; unsupported and mismatched formats fail during setup. When unset or `false`, vLLM uses fake-quantized generation. |
| `real_quant_ignore` | Optional list of vLLM parameter name patterns that should stay in native dtype during real-quant rollout. If omitted, NeMo RL uses the default ModelOpt NVFP4 ignore set for sensitive layers such as attention and output heads. For Nano3 hybrid MoE/Mamba W4A16 real-quant rollout, use the model-specific list shown in the Nano3 example recipe. |
| `real_quant_export_cpu_offload` | Optional boolean, default `true`. When `true`, packed NVFP4 export tensors are copied to CPU before refit. Set to `false` only for colocated CUDA-IPC refit without an explicit `refit_transport`; this avoids the CPU round trip at the cost of transient GPU memory. |

## Megatron Checkpoint Directory

On first run, the HF model is automatically converted to a Megatron checkpoint. By default, this checkpoint is saved under `$HF_HOME/nemo_rl` (or `~/.cache/huggingface/nemo_rl` if `HF_HOME` is not set). To control where the converted checkpoint is stored — for example, to keep it alongside your experiment outputs — set the `NRL_MEGATRON_CHECKPOINT_DIR` environment variable:

```bash
export NRL_MEGATRON_CHECKPOINT_DIR="/path/to/your/megatron/checkpoints"
```

## Differences from FP8 Training

QARL (via ModelOpt) and NeMo RL's built-in [FP8 training](../fp8.md) (via TransformerEngine) serve different purposes:

- **TransformerEngine FP8** focuses on **speeding up pre-training and fine-tuning** using real quantization. It replaces linear layers with FP8-native implementations that compute directly in reduced precision for throughput gains.

- **ModelOpt QARL** focuses on **recovering accuracy under quantization** using quantization-aware training. The policy forward pass uses quantized weights and, depending on the recipe, quantized activations while the backward pass uses full-precision gradients, so the model learns to be robust to quantization error. vLLM generation can run fake-quantized layers for W4A8/W4A16 recipes.
  W4A4 and W4A16 experiments can also use real ModelOpt NVFP4 kernels.

## Supported Quantization Formats

- **Weight quantization**: per-tensor, per-channel, and block-wise formats are supported by fake-quant rollout. Real-quant rollout specifically requires block-16 E2M1 NVFP4 weights with dynamic block scaling, packed on the policy side and streamed with FP8 block scales and global scales.
- **Input (activation) quantization**: fake-quant rollout supports the existing ModelOpt recipes. W4A4 real rollout specifically requires block-16 E2M1 NVFP4 inputs and streams one calibrated global input scale per dense projection or per expert projection.

## Exporting Megatron Checkpoints

After quantization-aware training, a Megatron checkpoint contains BF16 weights alongside quantization metadata (amax values, scales). To export it to a fully quantized HuggingFace format (with real low-precision weights), use the Megatron-Bridge export tool. The exported checkpoint is ready for deployment with inference engines like vLLM or TensorRT-LLM.

From within the NeMo RL container:

```bash
cd /opt/nemo-rl

PYTHONPATH=$PWD/3rdparty/Megatron-Bridge-workspace/Megatron-Bridge/3rdparty/Megatron-LM:${PYTHONPATH:-} \
uv run --extra mcore --extra modelopt \
  torchrun --nproc_per_node <pipeline-parallel-size> \
  examples/modelopt/export_quantized_to_hf.py \
  --hf-model-id <hf-model-name-or-path> \
  --megatron-load-path <path-to-megatron-checkpoint>/policy/weights \
  --export-dir <output-hf-directory> \
  --tp 1 --pp <pipeline-parallel-size>
```

- `examples/modelopt/export_quantized_to_hf.py` is a thin wrapper around `Megatron-Bridge/examples/quantization/export.py`. All CLI flags pass through to the upstream script unchanged.
- `--hf-model-id` should point to the original (pre-training) HuggingFace model so that the exporter knows the model architecture and tokenizer.
- The `PYTHONPATH` prefix exposes Megatron-LM's `megatron.training` to the bridge script.
- **`--tp 1` is required**: modelopt currently does not support TP>1 at export time. Training at TP>1 is fine; the bridge re-shards on load via `mp_overrides`.
- **`--pp` can be >1** for large models that don't fit on one GPU. `--nproc_per_node` must equal `--pp` (since `--tp` is fixed at 1).

## Limitations

- **Generation**: Currently only vLLM is supported for generation.
- **DTensor backend**: Quantization support for the DTensor policy worker is not yet implemented.
- **Real-quant rollout**: W4A4 and W4A16 are supported for dense and fused-MoE vLLM ModelOpt NVFP4 layers exported from the Megatron policy path. Fused MoE currently requires all experts local to each vLLM rank. Hybrid MoE/Mamba recipes should keep unsupported or sensitive non-MLP paths in BF16 via `real_quant_ignore`.
- **Router Replay (R3)**: R3 is supported on the Megatron policy path.
- **Input quantization**: W4A4 real rollout supports ModelOpt's block-16 E2M1 input format with a global scale per projection; other activation formats remain fake-quant only.
- **Static NVFP4 weights**: The real-quant exporter rejects static weight quantizers because their calibrated per-block amax state cannot be reconstructed after distributed TP/EP gathering. Use the dynamic block-scaling recipes shown above.
- **Model support**: Dense Transformer, MoE (Mixture of Experts), and hybrid MoE/Mamba models are supported on the Megatron policy + vLLM generation path when Megatron-Bridge and ModelOpt support the model architecture and quantization recipe.
