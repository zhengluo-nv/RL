# An In-depth Walkthrough of GRPO in NeMo RL

This guide details the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation within NeMo RL. We walk through data handling, policy model training, fast generation, and the GRPO loss function.

## Quickstart: Launch a GRPO Run

To get started quickly, use the script [examples/run_grpo.py](../../examples/run_grpo.py), which demonstrates how to train a model on math problems using GRPO. You can launch this script locally or through Slurm. For detailed instructions on setting up Ray and launching a job with Slurm, refer to the [cluster documentation](../cluster.md).

We recommend launching the job using `uv`:

```bash
uv run examples/run_grpo.py --config <PATH TO YAML CONFIG> {overrides}
```

If not specified, `config` will default to [examples/configs/grpo_math_1B.yaml](../../examples/configs/grpo_math_1B.yaml).

**Reminder**: Do not forget to set your HF_HOME, WANDB_API_KEY, and HF_DATASETS_CACHE (if needed). You'll need to do a `huggingface-cli login` as well for Llama models.

In this guide, we'll walk through how we handle:

* Data
* Model training
* Fast generation
* Overall resource flow
* Loss

### Data

We support training with multiple RL "Environments" at the same time.

An [Environment](../../nemo_rl/environments/interfaces.py) is an object that accepts a state/action history and returns an updated state and rewards for the step. They run as Ray Remote Actors. Example [MathEnvironment](../../nemo_rl/environments/math_environment.py).

To support this, we need to know:

* What environments you have
* Which data should go to which environments
* How to prepare the data from your dataset into a form we can use

#### Dataset

GRPO datasets in NeMo RL are encapsulated using classes. Each GRPO data class is expected to have the following attributes:
  1. `dataset`: A dictionary containing the formatted datasets. Each example in the dataset must conform to the format described below.
  2. `task_name`: A string identifier that uniquely identifies the dataset.

GRPO datasets are expected to follow the HuggingFace chat format. Refer to the [chat dataset document](../design-docs/chat-datasets.md) for details. If your data is not in the correct format, simply write a preprocessing script to convert the data into this format. [response_datasets/deepscaler.py](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/response_datasets/deepscaler.py) has an example:

**Note:** The `task_name` field is required in each formatted example.

```python
def format_data(self, data: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": data["problem"]},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": data["answer"]},
        ],
        "task_name": self.task_name,
    }
```

By default, NeMo RL has some built-in supported datasets (e.g., [OpenAssistant](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/response_datasets/oasst.py), [NuminaMath-1.5](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/response_datasets/numinamath.py), [OpenMathInstruct-2](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/response_datasets/openmathinstruct2.py), [Squad](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/response_datasets/squad.py), etc.). You can see the full list [here](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/response_datasets/__init__.py).
All of these datasets are downloaded from HuggingFace and preprocessed on-the-fly, so there's no need to provide a path to any datasets on disk.

We provide a [ResponseDataset](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/response_datasets/response_dataset.py) class that is compatible with JSONL-formatted response datasets for loading datasets from local path or Hugging Face. You can use `input_key`, `output_key` to specify which fields in your data correspond to the question and answer respectively. Here's an example configuration:
```yaml
data:
  # other data settings, see `examples/configs/grpo_math_1B.yaml` for more details
  ...
  # dataset settings
  train:
    # this dataset will override input_key and use the default values for other vars
    data_path: /path/to/local/train_dataset.jsonl  # local file or hf_org/hf_dataset_name (HuggingFace)
    input_key: question
    subset: null  # used for HuggingFace datasets
    split: train  # used for HuggingFace datasets
    split_validation_size: 0.05  # use 5% of the training data as validation data
    seed: 42  # seed for train/validation split when split_validation_size > 0
  validation:
    # this dataset will use the default values for other vars except data_path
    data_path: /path/to/local/val_dataset.jsonl
  default:
    # will use below vars as default values if dataset doesn't specify it
    dataset_name: ResponseDataset
    input_key: input
    output_key: output
    prompt_file: null
    system_prompt_file: null
    processor: "math_hf_data_processor"
    env_name: "math"
```

Your JSONL files should contain one JSON object per line with the following structure:

```json
{
  "input": "Hello",     // <input_key>: <input_content>
  "output": "Hi there!" // <output_key>: <output_content>
}
```

We support using multiple datasets for train and validation. You can refer to `examples/configs/grpo_multiple_datasets.yaml` for a full configuration example. Here's an example configuration:
```yaml
data:
  _override_: true # override the data config instead of merging with it
  # other data settings, see `examples/configs/grpo_math_1B.yaml` for more details
  ...
  # dataset settings
  train:
    # train dataset 1
    - dataset_name: OpenMathInstruct-2
      split_validation_size: 0.05 # use 5% of the training data as validation data
      seed: 42  # seed for train/validation split when split_validation_size > 0
    # train dataset 2
    - dataset_name: DeepScaler
  validation:
    # validation dataset 1
    - dataset_name: AIME2024
      repeat: 16
    # validation dataset 2
    - dataset_name: DAPOMathAIME2024
  # default settings for all datasets
  default:
    ...
```

`AIME2025` and `AIME2026` are registered alongside `AIME2024` and accept the same config keys (e.g. `repeat`), so any of them can drop into the `validation:` list above.

##### Custom datasets defined outside NeMo RL

If you want to plug in a dataset class that lives outside the `nemo_rl`
package (so you don't have to edit the built-in registry), set
`dataset_name` to a fully qualified dotted import path. The dispatcher
will import the module and resolve the class. The class must accept the
same kwargs as the built-in datasets (i.e. the full data config) and
implement `set_task_spec` and `set_processor`.

```yaml
data:
  default:
    dataset_name: my_pkg.my_module.MyDataset  # importable from PYTHONPATH
```

The class must be importable — install it as a package or add its
parent directory to `PYTHONPATH` before launching training.

We support using a single dataset for both train and validation by using `split_validation_size` to set the validation ratio.
This works for any dataset class that calls `split_train_validation` in its `__init__` — which today includes most built-in datasets, among them [OpenAssistant](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/response_datasets/oasst.py), [OpenMathInstruct-2](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/response_datasets/openmathinstruct2.py), [OpenR1-Math-220k](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/response_datasets/openr1_math.py), [ResponseDataset](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/response_datasets/response_dataset.py), and [Tulu3SftMixtureDataset](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/response_datasets/tulu3.py).
A dataset class that does not call it ignores `split_validation_size`; the dataset dispatcher emits a warning in that case, so a misconfigured run is not silent.
If you want to support this feature for your custom datasets or other built-in datasets, you can simply add the code to the dataset like [ResponseDataset](../../nemo_rl/data/datasets/response_datasets/response_dataset.py).
```python
# `self.val_dataset` is used (not None) only when current dataset is used for both training and validation
self.val_dataset = None
self.split_train_validation(split_validation_size, seed)
```

#### Common Data Format

We define a [DatumSpec](../../nemo_rl/data/interfaces.py) that holds all relevant information for each training example:

```python
class DatumSpec(TypedDict):
    message_log: LLMMessageLogType
    length: int  # total (concatenated) length of the message tensors
    extra_env_info: dict[str, Any] # anything your environment requires goes here, for example the 'answer' of a math problem
    loss_multiplier: float  # multiplier for the loss for this datum. 0 to mask out (say the sample is invalid)
    idx: int
    task_name: Optional[str] = "default"
    __extra__: Any  # This allows additional fields of any type
```

#### Data Processors

We refer to each distinct environment your model aims to optimize against as a "task." For example, you might define tasks like "math" or "code."

For each task, you should provide a data processor that reads from your dataset and returns a [DatumSpec](../../nemo_rl/data/interfaces.py).

```python
def my_data_processor(
    datum_dict: dict[str, Any], # loaded directly from your dataset (that is, a single line of JSONL data)
    task_data_spec: TaskDataSpec,
    tokenizer,
    max_seq_length: int,
    idx: int,
) -> DatumSpec:
```

We have an example of this as `math_data_processor` in [processors.py](../../nemo_rl/data/processors.py).

#### Multiple Dataloaders

By default, NeMo RL uses a single dataloader that aggregates data from multiple datasets. For scenarios requiring fine-grained control over the number of prompts loaded from each dataset, NeMo RL provides support for multiple dataloaders.

The following example demonstrates how to configure multiple dataloaders:

```bash
uv run examples/run_grpo.py \
    --config examples/configs/grpo_multiple_datasets.yaml \
    grpo.num_prompts_per_step=32 \
    data.use_multiple_dataloader=true \
    data.num_prompts_per_dataloader=16 \
    data.custom_dataloader=examples.custom_dataloader.custom_dataloader.example_custom_dataloader
```

For example, consider using `example_custom_dataloader`, which samples data from each dataloader sequentially.

Given two datasets:
- Dataset 1: `[a, b, c, d]`
- Dataset 2: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`

With `data.use_multiple_dataloader=false` and `grpo.num_prompts_per_step=4`:
```
Batch 1: [a, b, c, d]
Batch 2: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Batch 3: [5, 6, 7, 8]
```

With `data.use_multiple_dataloader=true`, `grpo.num_prompts_per_step=4`, and `data.num_prompts_per_dataloader=2`:
```
Batch 1: [a, b, 1, 2]
Batch 2: [c, d, 3, 4]
Batch 3: [a, b, 5, 6]
```

**Custom Dataloader**

The file `examples/custom_dataloader/custom_dataloader.py` provides a reference implementation that samples `data.num_prompts_per_dataloader` entries from each dataloader.

When a single dataloader is exhausted, the data iterator must be reset in the custom dataloader function (as demonstrated in `examples/custom_dataloader/custom_dataloader.py`).
This design ensures that the [MultipleDataloaderWrapper](../../nemo_rl/data/dataloader.py) operates as an infinite iterator, where `__next__()` will not raise StopIteration and `__len__()` is not supported.

Additionally, custom dataloaders can access recorded metrics from the training loop. Use `wrapped_dataloader.set_records()` in `nemo_rl/algorithms/grpo.py` to store relevant information, which can then be retrieved in your custom dataloader implementation:

```python
# In nemo_rl/algorithms/grpo.py
wrapped_dataloader.set_records({"reward": ...})

# In custom_dataloader.py
def example_custom_dataloader(
    data_iterators: dict[str, Iterator],
    dataloaders: dict[str, StatefulDataLoader],
    **kwargs,
) -> tuple[BatchedDataDict, dict[str, Iterator]]:
    ...
    reward = kwargs["reward"]
    ...
```

**num_prompts_per_dataloader**

This parameter specifies the number of prompts generated by each dataloader per iteration. Ensure that `grpo.num_prompts_per_step` is a multiple of `data.num_prompts_per_dataloader` to guarantee that exactly `grpo.num_prompts_per_step` prompts are available for each training step.

### Task–Dataset Mapping

- task_name (unique task identifier):
  - Determines which processor, env, prompts, and dataset to use for this task.
  - Currently, we support a single dataset and a single environment. Therefore, task_name equals the dataset_name in the config (i.e., config.data.train.dataset_name).
- task_spec (TaskDataSpec):
  - Specifies per-task system prompt and prompt.
- task_data_processors:
  - Dict mapping: task_name -> (task_spec, processor_fn).
- task_to_env:
  - Dict mapping: task_name -> task_env.

Example (simplified):

```python
task_data_processors = {data.task_name: (data.task_spec, data.processor)}
task_to_env = {data.task_name: env}
```

#### Putting It All Together

GRPO expects datasets to have the following form:

```json
{"task_name": "math", /* actual data */}
```

Then, you can set the data up as follows:

```python

# 1) Setup environments from data config
env_name_list = extract_necessary_env_names(data_config)
envs = {
    env_name: create_env(env_name=env_name, env_config=env_configs[env_name])
    for env_name in env_name_list
}

# 2) Load dataset using the helper (built-ins or local/HF datasets)
data = load_response_dataset(data_config["train"])

# 3) Build task mapping
task_data_processors = {data.task_name: (data.task_spec, data.processor)}
task_to_env = {data.task_name: envs[data_config["train"]["env_name"]]}

# 4) Construct processed dataset
dataset = AllTaskProcessedDataset(
    data.dataset,
    tokenizer,
    None,
    task_data_processors,
    max_seq_length=data_config["max_input_seq_length"],
)

# 5) Do the same thing for validation dataset if it exists
if "validation" in data_config and data_config["validation"] is not None:
    val_data = load_response_dataset(data_config["validation"])

    val_task_data_processors = {val_data.task_name: (val_data.task_spec, val_data.processor)}
    val_task_to_env = {val_data.task_name: envs[data_config["validation"]["env_name"]]}

    val_dataset = AllTaskProcessedDataset(
        val_data.dataset,
        tokenizer,
        None,
        val_task_data_processors,
        max_seq_length=data_config["max_input_seq_length"],
    )
```

Ensure you provide a mapping of tasks to their processors so the dataset knows which processor to use when handling samples.

## Environments

GRPO supports various types of environments for different tasks, including **[Math](../../nemo_rl/environments/math_environment.py)**, **[Code](../../nemo_rl/environments/code_environment.py)**, and **[Reward Model](../../nemo_rl/environments/reward_model_environment.py)** environments. Each environment provides a standardized interface for reward computation and evaluation, enabling consistent training across diverse domains.

For more information about environments, see the [Environments Guide](environments.md).

### Env–Task Mapping

- env:
  - The environment actor for reward/evaluation, constructed using `create_env(env_name=..., env_config=...)`.
  - The environment to use is declared under the data section of the config (e.g., `data.env_name` states which env the dataset uses).
- task_to_env:
  - Dict mapping: task_name -> env. In the current single-task setup this typically points all tasks to the same env, but this structure enables different envs per task in future multi-task scenarios.

Example (simplified):

```python
env_name_list = extract_necessary_env_names(data_config)
envs = {
    env_name: create_env(env_name=env_name, env_config=env_configs[env_name])
    for env_name in env_name_list
}

task_to_env[task_name] = envs[data_config["train"]["env_name"]]
val_task_to_env = task_to_env  # validation usually mirrors training mapping
```

## Policy Model

We define a {py:class}`~nemo_rl.models.policy.interfaces.PolicyInterface` that contains everything you need to train a Policy model.

This Policy object holds a [RayWorkerGroup](../../nemo_rl/distributed/worker_groups.py) of SPMD (1 proc/GPU) processes that run HF/MCore, all coordinated by this object so it appears to you like 1 GPU!

## Fast Generation

We support vLLM through the [VllmGeneration](../../nemo_rl/models/generation/vllm/vllm_generation.py) class right now.

The function, [grpo_train](../../nemo_rl/algorithms/grpo.py), contains the core GRPO training loop.

### Generation Sampling Parameters (temperature, top-p, top-k)

GRPO uses temperature, top-p (nucleus sampling), and top-k sampling during rollout generation via vLLM; these settings are aligned with the training. For a detailed description of top-p and top-k filtering, see [Top-p and top-k filtering](#top-p-and-top-k-filtering) below.

**Known issue (Qwen models):** For some Qwen-based models, a `ValueError: Token id 151708 is out of vocabulary` error may occur when the policy drifts from its initial distribution. Setting `top_p` to `0.9999` in the generation config is a recommended workaround. For details and discussion, see [#237](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/issues/237).

## Performance Optimizations

RL generations typically produce highly variable sequence lengths, which result in a significant amount of padding if approached naively. We address this with Sequence Packing and Dynamic Batching, which are techniques to reduce the amount of padding required. You can read more about these in the [design doc](../design-docs/sequence-packing-and-dynamic-batching.md).

### Chunked Fused Linear Logprobs

During standard GRPO training the model materializes a full logit tensor of shape `[batch_size, seq_length, vocab_size]` for the policy forward-backward pass as well as for the previous-policy and reference-policy logprob computations. This can cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors for long sequences or large vocabularies. The **chunked fused linear logprobs** path avoids this by computing the per-token log probabilities directly from the hidden states with a fused linear cross-entropy kernel: it chunks the sequence dimension, projects each chunk to logits on the fly, gathers the realized-token log probabilities, and discards the logits before moving to the next chunk. (GRPO uses the kernel only to read logprobs; it does not compute a cross-entropy loss.)

This works for GRPO because [ClippedPGLossFn](../../nemo_rl/algorithms/loss/loss_functions.py) only consumes the per-token log probability of the realized token (`next_token_logprobs`), which is exactly what the fused forward returns.

**Benefits:**

- Extends the maximum trainable sequence length significantly by eliminating the large logit tensor from GPU memory.
- Applies to both the training forward-backward pass and the previous/reference-policy logprob computations.
- Produces numerically equivalent loss values to the standard path.

**How to enable:**

Add the following to your Megatron config in your YAML file:

```yaml
policy:
  megatron_cfg:
    enabled: true
    use_fused_linear_logprobs: true
    fused_linear_logprobs_chunk_size: 256  # tokens per chunk; smaller = less memory, larger = more throughput
```

**Notes:**

- Only supported on the Megatron backend (`policy.megatron_cfg.enabled: true`).
- Context parallelism is not supported when fused linear logprobs are enabled.
- Sequence packing is not supported with fused linear logprobs; set `policy.sequence_packing.enabled: false`. The fused forward rolls labels over the whole packed sequence and would mix tokens across packed-sequence boundaries.
- Top-k/top-p training-time filtering is not supported with fused linear logprobs (set `policy.generation.top_k: null` and `policy.generation.top_p: 1.0`), because the fused path gathers logprobs from the unfiltered logits.
- The `fused_linear_logprobs_chunk_size` parameter controls the trade-off between memory savings and compute throughput. The default value of 256 is a good starting point.

## Loss
We use the [ClippedPGLossFn](../../nemo_rl/algorithms/loss/loss_functions.py) to calculate the loss for GRPO. Formally,

$$
L(\theta) = E_{x \sim \pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}} \Big[ \min \Big(\frac{\pi_\theta(x)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(x)}A_t, \text{clip} \big( \frac{\pi_\theta(x)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(x)}, 1 - \varepsilon, 1 + \varepsilon \big) A_t \Big) \Big] - \beta D_{\text{KL}} (\pi_\theta \| \pi_\text{ref})
$$

where:

- $\pi_\theta$ is the policy model we are currently optimizing
- $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$ is the previous policy model (from the beginning of this step)
- $A_t$ is the advantage estimate
- $\varepsilon$ is a clipping hyperparameter
- $\beta$ is the KL penalty coefficient
- $\pi_{\text{ref}}$ is the reference policy

It also supports "Dual-Clipping" from [Ye et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.09729), which
imposes an additional upper bound on the probability ratio when advantages are negative.
This prevents excessive policy updates. $rA \ll 0$ -> $cA$(clipped).
The loss function is modified to the following when A_t < 0:

$$
L(\theta) = E_t \Big[ \max \Big( \min \big(r_t(\theta) A_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon) A_t \big), c A_t \Big) \Big] - \beta D_{\text{KL}} (\pi_\theta \| \pi_\text{ref})
$$

where:
- c is the dual-clip parameter (ratio_clip_c), which must be greater than 1 and is usually set to 3 empirically.
- $r_t(\theta)$ is the ratio $\frac{\pi_\theta(x)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(x)}$ that measures how much the policy has changed.

### Improvements to the GRPO Loss Formulation for Stability and Accuracy

#### On-Policy KL Approximation

This feature is controlled by the parameter `use_on_policy_kl_approximation`. It enables the use of an estimator for KL divergence based on [Schulman (2020)](http://joschu.net/blog/kl-approx.html), which is both unbiased and guaranteed to be positive.

$$
D_{\text{KL}} (\pi_\theta || \pi_\text{ref}) \approx E_{x \sim \pi_{\theta}} \Big[ \frac{\pi_\text{ref}(x)}{\pi_\theta(x)} - \log \frac{\pi_\text{ref}(x)}{\pi_\theta(x)} - 1 \Big]
$$

Note that the loss function above samples from $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$ instead of $\pi_\theta$, meaning that the KL approximation is off-policy if we use samples from $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$. This is the default formulation used in the [original GRPO paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300). In order to use an _on-policy_ KL approximation while sampling from $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$, we can incorporate importance weights:

$$
\begin{align*}
D_{\text{KL}} (\pi_\theta || \pi_\text{ref}) &\approx E_{x \sim \pi_{\theta}} \Big[ \frac{\pi_\text{ref}(x)}{\pi_\theta(x)} - \log \frac{\pi_\text{ref}(x)}{\pi_\theta(x)} - 1 \Big] \\
&= \sum_x \pi_{\theta}(x) \Big[ \frac{\pi_\text{ref}(x)}{\pi_\theta(x)} - \log \frac{\pi_\text{ref}(x)}{\pi_\theta(x)} - 1 \Big] \\
&= \sum_x \pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(x) \frac{\pi_{\theta}(x)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(x)} \Big[ \frac{\pi_\text{ref}(x)}{\pi_\theta(x)} - \log \frac{\pi_\text{ref}(x)}{\pi_\theta(x)} - 1 \Big] \\
&= E_{x \sim \pi_{\theta_\text{old}}} \frac{\pi_{\theta}(x)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(x)} \Big[ \frac{\pi_\text{ref}(x)}{\pi_\theta(x)} - \log \frac{\pi_\text{ref}(x)}{\pi_\theta(x)} - 1 \Big] \\
\end{align*}
$$

To enable the on-policy KL approximation, set the config `use_on_policy_kl_approximation=True` in the `ClippedPGLossConfig`. By default, we set this config to False to align with standard GRPO.


#### Importance Sampling Correction
This feature is controlled by the parameter `use_importance_sampling_correction`. It applies importance sampling to adjust for discrepancies between the behavior policy and the target policy, improving the accuracy of off-policy estimates. The policy we use to draw samples, $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$, is used in both the inference framework and the training framework. To account for this distinction, we refer to the inference framework policy as $\pi_{\text{inference}}$ and the training framework policy as $\pi_{\text{training}}$. As noted in [Adding New Models](../adding-new-models.md#understand-discrepancies-between-backends), it is possible for the token probabilities from $\pi_{\text{training}}$ and $\pi_{\text{inference}}$ to have discrepancies (from numerics, precision differences, bugs, etc.), leading to off-policy samples. We can correct for this by introducing importance weights between $\pi_{\text{training}}$ and $\pi_{\text{inference}}$ to the first term of the loss function. 

Let $f_\theta(x) = \min \Big(\frac{\pi_\theta(x)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(x)}A_t, \text{clip} \big( \frac{\pi_\theta(x)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(x)}, 1 - \varepsilon, 1 + \varepsilon \big) A_t \Big)$ represent the first term of loss function. Then,

$$
\begin{align*}
E_{x \sim \pi_\text{training}} f_\theta(x) &= \sum_x \pi_\text{training}(x) f_\theta(x) \\
&= \sum_x \pi_\text{inference}(x) \frac{\pi_\text{training}(x)}{\pi_\text{inference}(x)} f_\theta(x) \\
&= E_{x \sim \pi_\text{inference}} \frac{\pi_\text{training}(x)}{\pi_\text{inference}(x)} f_\theta(x)
\end{align*}
$$

By multiplying the first term of the loss function by the importance weights $\frac{\pi_\text{training}(x)}{\pi_\text{inference}(x)}$, we can correct for the distribution mismatch between $\pi_{\text{training}}$ and $\pi_{\text{inference}}$ while still sampling from $\pi_{\text{inference}}$.

To enable the importance sampling correction, set the config `use_importance_sampling_correction=True` in the `ClippedPGLossConfig`. By default, we set this config to False to align with standard GRPO.


#### Overlong Filtering

This feature is controlled by the parameter `overlong_filtering`. It filters out sequences that exceed a predefined maximum length, helping maintain computational efficiency and model stability. When `overlong_filtering=True`, samples that reach `max_total_sequence_length` without producing an end-of-text token are excluded from loss computation. This reduces noise from penalizing generations that may be high-quality but exceed the sequence length limit.

The implementation modifies the loss calculation as follows:

For each sample $i$ in the batch:

$$
\text{truncated}_i = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if sample } i \text{ reached max length without EOS} \\ 
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
$$

The sample mask becomes (let m_i denote the sample mask and ℓ_i denote the loss multiplier):

$$
m_i = \ell_i \cdot (1 - \text{truncated}_i)
$$

This results in the effective loss:

$$
L_{\text{effective}} = \sum_{i} m_i \cdot L_i
$$

where $L_i$ is the per-sample loss. Truncated samples contribute 0 to the gradient update while remaining in the batch for reward baseline calculations.

To configure:
```yaml
grpo:
  overlong_filtering: false  # default
```

Set `overlong_filtering` to true when training on tasks where truncation at the maximum sequence length is expected, such as long-form reasoning or mathematical proofs.

#### Advantage Clipping

After advantage normalization, per-token advantages can become very large when the per-prompt reward standard deviation is small. The optional `advantage_clip_low` and `advantage_clip_high` parameters clamp normalized advantages to a bounded range before policy training.

When both values are `null` (the default), no clipping is applied. When set, advantages are clamped after normalization:

$$
A_{\text{clipped}} = \text{clamp}(A,\ \text{advantage\_clip\_low},\ \text{advantage\_clip\_high})
$$

To configure:
```yaml
grpo:
  advantage_clip_low: null   # default: no lower bound
  advantage_clip_high: null  # default: no upper bound
```

Set explicit bounds (for example, `-5.0` and `5.0`) when small reward variance produces extreme normalized advantages that destabilize training.

#### Top-p and top-k filtering

The implementation aligns with vLLM’s top-p and top-k filtering by applying an equivalent process to the logits.

When top-p or top-k filtering is enabled, the following conventions apply:

- **`curr_logprobs` and `prev_logprobs`** are computed *with* filtering applied, for compatibility with the actor loss.
- **`reference_policy_logprobs`** is computed *without* filtering (see the `use_reference_model` in the policy worker).
- **KL divergence** uses `curr_logprobs_unfiltered`(`curr_logprobs` *without* filtering) so that it is consistent with the reference policy logprobs.

Under tensor parallelism (TP), enabling top-p or top-k adds communication overhead. The vocabulary is sharded across GPUs (vocab-parallel), while top-p and top-k require full-vocabulary probabilities. A naive all-gather of logits would require large additional memory. The implementation therefore switches to a batch–sequence-parallel layout via all-to-all communication, applies filtering over the full vocabulary, then switches back, avoiding materialization of the full vocabulary on any single rank.

## Metrics
This feature is controlled by the parameters `wandb_name` and `tb_name`. We track a few metrics during training for scientific experimentation and to validate correctness as the run progresses.

### Multiplicative Token Probability Error
This feature is controlled by the parameter `token_mult_prob_error`. It measures the error introduced when token probabilities are scaled multiplicatively, which can affect model calibration and output consistency. This is equal to the 'Logprob consistency metric' defined in [Adding New Models](../adding-new-models.md#importance-of-log-probability-consistency-in-training-and-inference):

$$
\text{token-mult-prob-error} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n\text{(tokens)}}\exp\left(\left\|\text{log-train-fwk}_i - \text{logprobs-inference-fwk}_i\right\|\right)
$$

Intuitively, this measures the average multiplicative probability error for sampled tokens, where samples are drawn as $x \sim \pi_{\text{inference-framework}}$. The purpose of this is to highlight any obvious sampling errors or discrepancies between the inference backend and training framework. If it trends upward steeply over the course of training past $\sim 1-2\%$, there is usually a problem with how your weights are being updated. If these metrics are very spiky, they can indicate a bug in the inference framework or buggy weight refitting.

### KL Divergence Error
This feature is controlled by the following metrics:
* `gen_kl_error`: $D_{\text{KL}}(P_{gen} || P_{policy})$
  - the generation distribution as ground truth
* `policy_kl_error`: $D_{\text{KL}}(P_{policy} || P_{gen})$
  - the policy (training) distribution as ground truth
* `js_divergence_error` or (Jensen–Shannon divergence): $(D_{\text{KL}}(P_{policy} || P_{m}) + D_{\text{KL}}(P_{gen} || P_{m})) / 2$, where $P_{m} = (P_{policy} + P_{gen}) / 2$
  - uses the mean mixture distribution as reference

According to the paper [When Speed Kills Stability: Demystifying RL Collapse from the Training-Inference Mismatch](https://yingru.notion.site/When-Speed-Kills-Stability-Demystifying-RL-Collapse-from-the-Training-Inference-Mismatch-271211a558b7808d8b12d403fd15edda), `gen_kl_error` was introduced (referred to as `vllm-kl` in the paper) as the key metric to measure the mismatch between the policy and generation distributions. Empirically, the mismatch is approximately 1e-3, and the divergence is larger for low-probability tokens as predicted by the generation inference engine (like vLLM).

The three divergence metrics provide complementary perspectives on distribution mismatch. For example:

We observed a case where vLLM assigned a disproportionately high probability to a single rare token, causing significant logprob error spikes (especially in MoE architectures):

```text
# extreme example
1. Position 4559: 'au' (ID: 1786)
   logp_gen     (from vLLM):      -5.xxx
   logp_policy (from Mcore):      -15.xxx
```
Assuming other tokens have near-zero divergence, this single token's metrics with `kl_type=k3` are:

* `gen_kl_error`: exp(-15 + 5) - (-15 + 5) - 1 ≈ 9 (moderate mismatch)
* `policy_kl_error`: exp(-5 + 15) - (-5 + 15) - 1 ≈ 22,015 (severe mismatch dominating the metric)
* `js_divergence_error`: ≈ 9, close to `gen_kl_error` since the mixture distribution (~-5.69) is dominated by the higher-probability value (logp_gen in this example)

Ideally, all KL divergence metrics should be close to 0, with values below 1e-3 considered acceptable. Investigate any metric that shows spikes above this threshold.

### Sampling Importance Ratio
This feature is controlled by the parameter `sampling_importance_ratio`. It adjusts the weighting of samples based on the ratio between the target policy and the behavior policy, helping to correct for distributional shift in off-policy learning. Not to be confused with the clipped importance ratio in PPO/GRPO, this is the importance ratio between $\pi_{\text{training}}$ and $\pi_{\text{inference}}$.

This is simply $\frac{1}{|T|}\sum_{t \in \text{tokens}}\text{exp}(\text{log}(\pi_{\text{training}}(t)) - \text{log}(\pi_{\text{inference}}(t)))$

Similar to [Multiplicative Token Probability Error](#multiplicative-token-probability-error), this is a measure of how far off your inference backend is from your training framework. However, this metric is meant to find the bias in that error, rather than the variance, as it does not take the absolute value of the error. With some noise, this should hover around 1.

This metric is always calculated and the per-token version (without the mean) is used in the loss function when [Importance Sampling Correction](#importance-sampling-correction) is enabled.

### Entropy
This feature is controlled by the parameter `approx_entropy`. It estimates the entropy of the policy distribution, which can be used to encourage exploration and prevent premature convergence during training. We roughly approximate the entropy of the LLM's distribution throughout training by calculating:

$$
E_{s \sim \pi_{\text{inference}}(x)}[-\frac{\pi_{\text{training}}(x)}{\pi_{\text{inference}}(x)}log(\pi_{\text{training}}(x))]
$$

This expectation is estimated using the rollouts in each global training batch as Monte Carlo samples. The ratio of $\pi$ values in the formula serves to apply importance correction for the mismatch between the training policy during a single GRPO step and the inference-time policy used to sample states.

We use this to track if our models are experiencing entropy collapse too quickly during training (as is quite common). This is a fairly rough Monte Carlo approximation, so we wouldn't recommend using this directly for an entropy bonus or otherwise backpropagating through this. You can take a look at NeMo Aligner's [implementation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner/blob/main/nemo_aligner/utils/distributed.py#L351) of a full entropy calculation if you're interested (work-in-progress efficient calculation in NeMo RL).

### GDPO: Group reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization for Multi-reward RL Optimization
GDPO is a reinforcement learning optimization method designed for multi-reward training. While existing approaches commonly apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-reward settings, the authors show that this leads to reward advantages collapse, reducing training signal resolution and causing unstable or failed convergence. GDPO resolves this issue by decoupling reward normalization across individual rewards, preserving their relative differences and enabling more faithful preference optimization. 

For a group of  \\( N \\) rewards and  \\( G \\) samples per group, GDPO normalizes each reward independently:

$$
A_n^{(i,j)} = \frac{r_n^{(i,j)} - \text{mean}\{r_n^{(i,1)}, \ldots, r_n^{(i,G)}\}}{\text{std}\{r_n^{(i,1)}, \ldots, r_n^{(i,G)}\} + \epsilon}
$$

The normalized group advantage is then aggregated across rewards:

$$
A^{(i,j)} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n A_n^{(i,j)}
$$

The final per-batch normalization produces:

$$
\hat{A}^{(i,j)} = \frac{A^{(i,j)} - \text{mean}_{i',j'}\{A^{(i',j')}\}}{\text{std}_{i',j'}\{A^{(i',j')}\} + \epsilon}
$$

Here,  \\( \text{mean}_{i',j'}\{A^{(i',j')}\} \\) and  \\( \text{std}_{i',j'}\{A^{(i',j')}\} \\) denote statistics over all groups in the batch.

To enable GDPO for multi-reward RL training, simply set:
```
grpo:
  adv_estimator:
    name: "gdpo"
    normalize_rewards: true
    use_leave_one_out_baseline: false
```
Note that this method only has an effect when training involves more than one reward function.

#### Per-reward weights

The aggregation weights \\( w_n \\) in \\( A^{(i,j)} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n A_n^{(i,j)} \\)
are configurable via `reward_weights`, an optional list with one entry per reward
component, ordered alphabetically by component name (matching the sorted `reward/<name>`
keys). When omitted, all weights default to `1.0` (equal weighting). For example, to
down-weight the second and third rewards:
```
grpo:
  adv_estimator:
    name: "gdpo"
    normalize_rewards: true
    use_leave_one_out_baseline: false
    reward_weights: [1.0, 0.5, 0.25]
```
The number of weights must equal the number of reward components, or a `ValueError` is raised.

#### Comparing GDPO against a GRPO baseline

The clearest way to see GDPO's effect is a matched comparison on the same multi-reward environment, changing only the advantage estimator. `examples/configs/gdpo_math_1B.yaml` runs GDPO; the GRPO control is the same config with `adv_estimator.name=grpo` (plus a separate checkpoint dir and logger run name so the two runs don't clobber each other):

```
# GDPO
uv run examples/run_grpo.py --config examples/configs/gdpo_math_1B.yaml
# GRPO control on the SAME multi-reward env — only the advantage estimator changes
uv run examples/run_grpo.py --config examples/configs/gdpo_math_1B.yaml \
    grpo.adv_estimator.name=grpo \
    checkpointing.checkpoint_dir=results/grpo_math_1B_control \
    logger.wandb.name=grpo-math-1b-control
```

For intuition on why this matters, see the advantage-collapse example in the [GDPO paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05242): two responses with the same total reward but different composition (e.g. `(1, 0)` vs. `(0, 1)`) receive an identical advantage under GRPO but distinct advantages under GDPO.

#### What to measure

The headline metric is per-reward convergence, not just aggregate reward. NeMo-RL does not log per-component rewards out of the box (only `total_reward` aggregates are logged), but the components are available as `reward/<name>` keys (e.g. `reward/correctness`) in the rollout batch — add your own logging for them and compare the GDPO and GRPO curves:

- Under GRPO, expect components to move together, or low-variance components to stall as their signal is swamped by the dominant term in the sum.
- Under GDPO, expect each component to improve on its own schedule.
- Watch the per-prompt advantage spread: if distinct reward combinations produce near-identical advantages under GRPO, that is the collapse GDPO is meant to fix.

#### Practical notes

- **Reward scaling applies per component.** `reward_scaling` rescales each `reward/<name>` component as well as `total_reward`, so keep components on comparable scales or rely on GDPO's per-component normalization.
- **Final batch normalization always runs.** In `GDPOAdvantageEstimator`, the final per-batch normalization applies regardless of `normalize_rewards` (which only gates the per-component std division). Account for this when reasoning about advantage magnitudes.

## LoRA Configuration

GRPO supports LoRA on both the DTensor and Megatron backends. To enable LoRA on the default DTensor backend:

```bash
uv run examples/run_grpo.py policy.dtensor_cfg.lora_cfg.enabled=true
```

The DTensor GRPO LoRA path uses a merge-weight approach: during generation, LoRA adapter weights are merged into the base linear weights. This improves performance, with a small training-inference mismatch that we consider acceptable. If you require strict training-inference parity, use the [split-weight variant branch](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/tree/ruit/lora_grpo_async), which may trade off some performance. For a comparison between merge-weight and split-weight, see [PR 1797: Support lora in dtensor grpo workflow by merging weight](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/pull/1797).

For the full reference — backend support, the DTensor vs Megatron schema comparison, config examples, parameter details, and example recipes — see the dedicated [LoRA guide](lora.md).
