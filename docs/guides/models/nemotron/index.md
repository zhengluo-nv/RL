# Nemotron

This is the landing page for Nemotron model guidance in NeMo RL. It links to
model-specific subpages that cover the released post-training recipes, launch
instructions, and known issues for each variant.

For the full list of supported models, see
[Model Support](../../../about/model-support.md).

## Model Guides

- **[Nemotron 3 Nano](nemotron-3-nano.md)** — GRPO math post-training for the
  30B-A3B hybrid Mamba MoE model, including data preparation and Slurm launch
  scripts.
- **[Nemotron 3 Nano Omni](nemotron-3-nano-omni.md)** — GRPO for the Nano Omni
  vision-language model on the AutoModel and Megatron backends
  (CLEVR-CoGenT and MMPR-Tiny recipes).
- **[Nemotron 3 Super](nemotron-3-super.md)** — the multi-stage Nemotron 3
  Super post-training recipe (RLVR, SWE, and RLHF stages).
- **[Nemotron 3 Ultra](nemotron-3-ultra.md)** — RLVR, teacher training, and
  MOPD stages on GB200 NVL72 hardware.
- **[Nemotron 3.5 Lightning](nemotron-3.5-lightning.md)** — RLVR with NeMo Gym
  on GB200, plus a compact 4-node DAPO math recipe on the DTensor (AutoModel)
  backend.
