# Nemotron 3 Ultra

**Technical Report:** [NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra Technical Report](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/nemotron/files/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Ultra-Technical-Report.pdf)

This guide explains how to post-train the Nemotron 3 Ultra model with NeMo RL on
**GB200 NVL72** (ARM64 / aarch64) hardware.

## Overview

Nemotron 3 Ultra is post-trained with a multi-stage pipeline that mixes
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), RLHF, and Multi-Teacher
On-Policy Distillation (MOPD) from a panel of specialised teacher models. The
main stages are:

1. **Student RLVR** — produces the student policy from the supervised
   fine-tuning (SFT) checkpoint using GRPO with verifiable rewards.
2. **Teacher training** — trains a panel of teachers (the Student RLVR policy
   itself serves as the general teacher, alongside specialised teachers such as
   reasoning, instruction-following/abstention, RLHF chat, and SWE).
3. **MOPD** — on-policy distillation from the student into the teacher panel.

Every stage shares the same launcher (`ultra_launch.sh`) and a per-stage YAML
config under `examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/`.

### Checkpoint flow

The pipeline starts from an SFT checkpoint and produces a panel of teacher
checkpoints that, together with the Student RLVR output, feed MOPD. The Student
RLVR policy itself serves as the general teacher:

```

```

## Container

Ultra uses vLLM and requires an **aarch64 (arm64)** image for GB200 NVL72
nodes. Prebake the NeMo Gym virtual environments used by the recipes to avoid
building them when each training job starts. From the root of the repository,
build the image with the Gym virtual environments for the Ultra recipes:

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/arm64 \
  --progress=plain \
  -f docker/Dockerfile \
  --target release \
  -t <your-registry>/nemo-rl:main-ultra-prefetched-venvs \
  --push \
  --build-context nemo-rl=. \
  --build-arg MAX_JOBS=8 \
  --build-arg SKIP_SGLANG_BUILD=1 \
  --build-arg SKIP_TRTLLM_BUILD=1 \
  --build-arg NEMO_GYM_PREFETCH_CONFIGS="examples/nemo_gym/prefetch_ultra_all_envs.yaml" \
  .
```

Build args:
- `NEMO_GYM_PREFETCH_CONFIGS` — space-separated union configs whose Gym virtual
  environments are baked into the image.
- `SKIP_SGLANG_BUILD=1` — Ultra runs on vLLM; skip the SGLang build.
- `SKIP_TRTLLM_BUILD=1` — Ultra does not use TensorRT-LLM; skip its build.
- `MAX_JOBS` — parallel build jobs; tune to your machine.
- `--build-context nemo-rl=.` — build from your local checkout (otherwise the
  Dockerfile pulls `NVIDIA-NeMo/RL.git#main`).

To run on the cluster with Slurm, convert the image to a squashfs (`.sqsh`)
with [enroot](https://github.com/NVIDIA/enroot):

```bash
enroot import -o nemo-rl-container.sqsh \
  docker://<your-registry>/nemo-rl:main-ultra-prefetched-venvs
```

Pass the resulting image as `CONTAINER` in every launch command below (shown as
`CONTAINER=/path/to/nemo-rl-container` — a `.sqsh` path, or a registry image URI
if you're not using enroot). All Ultra stages run from this single image.

## Download and prepare the data

The training blends are published as
[`nvidia/Nemotron-RL-Ultra-Training-Blends`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-RL-Ultra-Training-Blends),
one JSONL per stage: `rlvr1`, `rlvr2`, `ifbench`, `rlhf`, `reasoning`, `swe`, and
`mopd`. Math rows that originate from `BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Math-17k` and
`Skywork/Skywork-OR1-RL-Data` ship as placeholders; the bundled
`fill_placeholders.py` restores them from the original datasets on Hugging Face.

```bash
export DATA_DIR=/path/to/ultra/data

# 1. Download the blends + fill_placeholders.py
huggingface-cli download nvidia/Nemotron-RL-Ultra-Training-Blends \
  --repo-type dataset --local-dir ultra-blends

# 2. Restore the DAPO / Skywork placeholders into $DATA_DIR
cd ultra-blends
./fill_placeholders.py --input-dir . --output-dir "$DATA_DIR"   # requires uv
```

This produces `$DATA_DIR/{rlvr1,rlvr2,ifbench,rlhf,reasoning,swe,mopd}.jsonl`. Hold
out the last 100 rows of each blend as a validation split — the launch commands
below consume `<name>.train.jsonl` as `TRAIN_PATH` and `<name>.val.jsonl` as
`VAL_PATH`:

```bash
cd "$DATA_DIR"
for name in rlvr1 rlvr2 ifbench rlhf reasoning swe mopd; do
  head -n -100 "$name.jsonl" > "$name.train.jsonl"
  tail -n 100   "$name.jsonl" > "$name.val.jsonl"
done
```

By electing to use the external datasets you are responsible for confirming their
licenses are fit for your intended use.

The SWE stage additionally requires per-instance `.sif` container images built
from SWE-Gym and SWE-rebench-V2 — see [SWE Teacher](#swe-teacher) for the build
steps.

For now, each stage takes a JSONL training file and a JSONL validation file
(see [Launch script](#launch-script) below).

## Prepare the code

```bash
git clone --recursive -b main https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL.git
cd RL
```

## Build the sandbox container

Several [Gym](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Gym) environments used during
training (notably `ns_tools` for stateful Python execution with math
verification, and `math_formal_lean` for Lean4 proof verification) rely on a
sandbox container. Build it from the
[NeMo-Skills Dockerfile](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Skills/blob/main/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.sandbox):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Skills.git
cd Skills
git checkout b620e79   # Skills commit pinned for the Ultra release
docker build -t nemo-skills-sandbox:latest -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile.sandbox .
```

For SLURM clusters using [enroot](https://github.com/NVIDIA/enroot), convert
to a `.sqsh`:

```bash
enroot import -o nemo-skills-sandbox.sqsh dockerd://nemo-skills-sandbox:latest
```

## Launch script

Every stage is submitted with `examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/ultra_launch.sh`,
run from the repo root. The launcher
handles SLURM submission, code snapshotting, persistent cache management, and
container mounts — stage-specific hyperparameters (batch size, advantage clip,
MoE parallelism, learning rate) live in the per-stage YAML.

Set the following before each `bash examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/ultra_launch.sh` invocation:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `EXP_NAME` | Job name, W&B run name, and the suffix for output directories. Must be unique per run; same name across resubmissions resumes from the latest checkpoint. |
| `CONFIG_PATH` | Path to the per-stage YAML config (e.g. `examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/student_rlvr1.yaml`). |
| `MODEL_PATH` | Initial policy checkpoint (HuggingFace repo id or local path). Student RLVR starts from the Ultra SFT checkpoint; the teacher stages start from the Student RLVR checkpoint; MOPD starts from the student (the Student RLVR checkpoint). |
| `TRAIN_PATH` | Training data JSONL. |
| `VAL_PATH` | Validation data JSONL. |
| `CONTAINER` | NeMo RL container image (`.sqsh` path or registry image URI). |
| `SANDBOX_CONTAINER` | Sandbox image from [Build the sandbox container](#build-the-sandbox-container). |
| `PERSISTENT_CACHE` | Directory on a shared filesystem (e.g. Lustre) where vLLM/Triton/Inductor compile caches are persisted across runs. |
| `EXTRA_MOUNTS` | Comma-separated `host:container` mount pairs for any shared filesystems holding your data, model checkpoints, and `PERSISTENT_CACHE` (e.g. `EXTRA_MOUNTS=/lustre:/lustre,/scratch:/scratch`). |
| `SLURM_PARTITION`, `SLURM_ACCOUNT` | Your SLURM cluster credentials. |
| `GENRM_MODEL` | GenRM judge: HF repo id or local path. Default is [`nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Ultra-550B-A55B-GenRM`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Ultra-550B-A55B-GenRM). Served in-cluster from the gym pool at TP=4 (DP varies by stage). Required unless `GENRM_BASE_URL` is set. |
| `GENRM_BASE_URL` | _Optional._ URL of a separately-deployed GenRM service (e.g. `http://genrm-host:9213/v1`). If set, routes judging to that endpoint and ignores `GENRM_MODEL`. Useful when sharing a single GenRM deployment across many training jobs. |
| `NL2BASH_JUDGE_MODEL` | NL2Bash / general-purpose judge: HF repo id or local path. Default judge is `Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507-FP8`. |
| `NL2BASH_BASE_URL` | _Optional._ URL of a separately-deployed NL2Bash judge service. Same semantics as `GENRM_BASE_URL`. |
| `SAFETY_JUDGE_MODEL` | Content-safety judge: HF repo id or local path. Default is [`nvidia/Nemotron-Content-Safety-Reasoning-4B`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Nemotron-Content-Safety-Reasoning-4B). |

> **Serving GenRM outside Gym.** For a separately deployed OpenAI-compatible
> endpoint, set `GENRM_BASE_URL=http://<host>:<port>/v1`. Judging is then routed
> to that endpoint instead of being served from the Gym pool, allowing one
> deployment to back multiple training runs.
>
> To co-schedule dedicated model servers with training in one Slurm
> heterogeneous allocation, set `EXTERNAL_JUDGES=1` — see
> [External judge services](#external-judge-services) below.

Optional knobs:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WALLTIME` | `4:00:00` | SLURM `--time` |
| `SLURM_QOS`, `SLURM_RESERVATION`, `EXCLUDE_NODES` | _empty_ | Optional SLURM flags |
| `NUM_TRAIN_NODES`, `NUM_GEN_NODES`, `NUM_GYM_NODES` | `64`, `172`, `20` | GB200 4-GPU node split. Total must be a multiple of 16. |
| `ENABLE_MTP_INFERENCE` | `0` | Set to `1` to enable MTP speculative decoding for vLLM |
| `NRL_MAX_STEPS` | _from YAML_ | Override `grpo.max_num_steps` |
| `WANDB_API_KEY`, `WANDB_PROJ`, `WANDB_ENTITY` | _unset_ / `nemotron-3-ultra` / _unset_ | W&B logging is disabled if `WANDB_API_KEY` is unset |
| `HF_HOME`, `HF_TOKEN` | _unset_ | Shared HuggingFace cache and gated-model token |
| `USE_SNAPSHOT` | `1` | Snapshot the source tree at submission time |
| `DRY_RUN` | `0` | Set to `1` to print the resolved `TRAIN_CMD` without submitting |

### External judge services

By default the GenRM and NL2Bash judges are served by NeMo Gym inside the
training Ray cluster, consuming part of `NUM_GYM_NODES`. Setting
`EXTERNAL_JUDGES=1` instead serves them as fixed-model vLLM pools in a second
Slurm heterogeneous component. This keeps judge serving off the training Ray
cluster, so a judge restart or OOM cannot destabilise training, and it lets each
judge be scaled independently of the Gym pool.

The launcher registers both pools through the
[external Gym vLLM pool helpers](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/blob/main/tools/external_gym_vllm/README.md)
and submits `tools/external_gym_vllm/run_in_allocation.sh` instead of `ray.sub`.
That wrapper starts every replica in its own private Ray cluster, brings up one
OpenAI-compatible load balancer per pool, waits for all backends to become
healthy, substitutes the resolved URLs into the driver command, and only then
starts `ray.sub` on the training component. If a required service exits, the
training job is stopped.

In this mode `GENRM_MODEL` and `NL2BASH_JUDGE_MODEL` are the checkpoints the
pools serve, and Gym addresses them by `GENRM_SERVED_MODEL_NAME` /
`NL2BASH_SERVED_MODEL_NAME` (both `model` by default). Setting
`GENRM_BASE_URL` or `NL2BASH_BASE_URL` by hand is rejected, since the wrapper
supplies those.

Each pool is registered only when its model variable is set, so set at least
one of them. Stages declare only the judges they use — `rlhf_teacher` has no
NL2Bash block, `reasoning_teacher` has no GenRM block, `swe_teacher` has
neither — and setting a judge the stage does not declare makes the driver fail
on an unknown config key.

`BASE_LOG_DIR` and `EXTERNAL_VLLM_TOOLS_DIR_HOST` (the repo's
`tools/external_gym_vllm`) must resolve under `EXTERNAL_VLLM_SHARED_ROOT`,
because the wrapper bind-mounts that root into the service containers. Since
`RESULTS_DIR` defaults to a path relative to the repo, pass an explicit
`BASE_LOG_DIR` on the shared filesystem when the checkout lives elsewhere.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `EXTERNAL_JUDGES` | `0` | `1` serves GenRM and NL2Bash in a second hetgroup |
| `GENRM_REPLICAS`, `GENRM_TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE` | `4`, `4` | Independent DP=1 GenRM servers and TP per server |
| `GENRM_REASONING_PARSER_NAME` | `nemotron_v3` | Reasoning parser for the GenRM; `nemotron_v3` is built into vLLM and handles the `<think>`/`</think>` format |
| `GENRM_REASONING_PARSER` | _unset_ | Path to a reasoning-parser plugin `.py`, only for a checkpoint whose parser vLLM does not ship |
| `NL2BASH_REPLICAS`, `NL2BASH_TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE` | `4`, `4` | Independent DP=1 NL2Bash servers and TP per server |
| `EXTERNAL_VLLM_SEGMENT_SIZE` | `4` | SLURM `--segment` for the external component |

Node counts are derived from the replica shapes, not set directly:
`nodes = REPLICAS × TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE / GPUS_PER_NODE` per pool. The two
components are validated separately — `NUM_TRAIN_NODES + NUM_GEN_NODES +
NUM_GYM_NODES` must be a multiple of `SEGMENT_SIZE`, and the external node total
must be a multiple of `EXTERNAL_VLLM_SEGMENT_SIZE`. With both judges external,
`NUM_GYM_NODES` only has to cover the safety judge. Model paths, the parser
plugin, and `BASE_LOG_DIR` must live under `EXTERNAL_VLLM_SHARED_ROOT`
(`/lustre` by default), which is mounted into the service containers.
`INTERACTIVE=1` is not supported in this mode.

Building on the [Phase 1](#phase-1--49k-context-128-steps) invocation, add:

```bash
EXTERNAL_JUDGES=1 \
GENRM_MODEL=/path/to/genrm-checkpoint \
GENRM_REPLICAS=16 \
NL2BASH_JUDGE_MODEL=/path/to/nl2bash-judge-checkpoint \
NL2BASH_REPLICAS=4 \
NUM_TRAIN_NODES=64 \
NUM_GEN_NODES=172 \
NUM_GYM_NODES=4 \
BASE_LOG_DIR=/lustre/path/to/ray_logs \
EXP_NAME=... CONFIG_PATH=... MODEL_PATH=... TRAIN_PATH=... VAL_PATH=... \
CONTAINER=... SANDBOX_CONTAINER=... PERSISTENT_CACHE=... \
SLURM_PARTITION=$SLURM_PARTITION SLURM_ACCOUNT=$SLURM_ACCOUNT \
SAFETY_JUDGE_MODEL=nvidia/Nemotron-Content-Safety-Reasoning-4B \
bash examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/ultra_launch.sh
```

That allocates 64 + 172 + 4 = 240 NeMo RL nodes (a multiple of `SEGMENT_SIZE`,
with Gym now hosting only the safety judge) plus 16 GenRM + 4 NL2Bash = 20
external nodes. Set only `GENRM_MODEL` or only `NL2BASH_JUDGE_MODEL` to move
just that judge out of Gym — useful for the teacher stages, which declare only
the judges they use.

## Stage 1 — Student RLVR

GRPO with verifiable rewards on the Ultra SFT checkpoint.

Student RLVR is split into two phases that share the same `EXP_NAME` so the
second phase resumes from the first phase's checkpoint:

| | Phase 1 | Phase 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Config | `examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/student_rlvr1.yaml` | `examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/student_rlvr2.yaml` |
| `max_total_sequence_length` | 49,152 | 65,536 |
| Steps in this phase | ~128 | ~50 |
| `NRL_MAX_STEPS` to set | `128` | `178` (= 128 + 50) |
| `group_answer_length_penalty_coeff` | 0.25 | 0.08 |

Both phases share TP=8, EP=64, CP=8, PP=1, GBS=8192 (512 prompts × 16
generations), advantage clip ±20, and the 256-node cluster shape.

### Phase 1 — 49k context, 128 steps

```bash
EXP_NAME=ultra-student-rlvr \
CONFIG_PATH=examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/student_rlvr1.yaml \

HF_HOME=/path/to/hf_cache \
HF_TOKEN=$HF_TOKEN \
bash examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/ultra_launch.sh
```

### Phase 2 — 65k context, ~50 more steps

Same env vars as Phase 1 but swap the config, raise `NRL_MAX_STEPS`, and point
at the Phase 2 training data file. Keep `EXP_NAME` and `RESULTS_DIR` identical
to Phase 1 so `CheckpointManager` auto-resumes from the latest Phase 1
checkpoint.

```bash
EXP_NAME=ultra-student-rlvr \
CONFIG_PATH=examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/student_rlvr2.yaml \
ENABLE_MTP_INFERENCE=1 \
NRL_MAX_STEPS=178 \
MODEL_PATH=/path/to/ultra_sft_checkpoint \
TRAIN_PATH=$DATA_DIR/rlvr2.train.jsonl \
VAL_PATH=$DATA_DIR/rlvr2.val.jsonl \
CONTAINER=/path/to/nemo-rl-container \
SANDBOX_CONTAINER=/path/to/nemo-skills-sandbox.sqsh \
PERSISTENT_CACHE=/path/to/persistent/cache \
EXTRA_MOUNTS=/lustre:/lustre \
SLURM_PARTITION=$SLURM_PARTITION \
SLURM_ACCOUNT=$SLURM_ACCOUNT \
GENRM_MODEL=nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Ultra-550B-A55B-GenRM \

HF_HOME=/path/to/hf_cache \
HF_TOKEN=$HF_TOKEN \
bash examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/ultra_launch.sh
```

Note: Phase 1 and Phase 2 use different training blends (`rlvr1.train.jsonl` and
`rlvr2.train.jsonl`); see the [Download and prepare the data](#download-and-prepare-the-data)
section above.

The launcher reports the experiment directory layout, sample monitoring
commands, and (on submission) the SLURM job id.

## Stage 2 — Teacher training

The teacher panel is a set of specialised RL runs that each start from the
Student RLVR output (Stage 1) (see [Checkpoint flow](#checkpoint-flow) above). Each teacher
runs independently with its own YAML config under `examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/`.

The teachers don't depend on each other and can run in parallel.

### IFBench Teacher

RLHF teacher specializing in instruction following, abstention, and refusal
behavior. Trained at 49k context with a smaller batch (`GBS=2048`) and lower
learning rate (`lr=2.5e-6`) than the student RLVR stage.

**Config:** `examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/ifbench_teacher.yaml`
- TP=8, EP=64, CP=8, PP=1
- `max_total_sequence_length=49152`
- `train_global_batch_size=2048`, `num_prompts_per_step=128`, `num_generations_per_prompt=16`
- Learning rate `2.5e-6` constant
- Default cluster shape: 80 nodes (32 training + 28 vLLM + 20 Gym)

```bash
EXP_NAME=ultra-ifbench-teacher \

bash examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/ultra_launch.sh
```

### RLHF Teacher

General-purpose RLHF teacher trained against the pairwise GenRM comparison
signal alone. Same training shape as the IFBench teacher (cluster, batch,
learning rate, context).

**Config:** `examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/rlhf_teacher.yaml`
- TP=8, EP=64, CP=8, PP=1
- `max_total_sequence_length=49152`
- `train_global_batch_size=2048`, `num_prompts_per_step=128`, `num_generations_per_prompt=16`
- Learning rate `2.5e-6` constant
- Default cluster shape: 80 nodes (32 training + 28 vLLM + 20 Gym)

```bash
EXP_NAME=ultra-rlhf-teacher \
CONFIG_PATH=examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/rlhf_teacher.yaml \
MODEL_PATH=/path/to/student_rlvr_output \
TRAIN_PATH=$DATA_DIR/rlhf.train.jsonl \
VAL_PATH=$DATA_DIR/rlhf.val.jsonl \
NUM_TRAIN_NODES=32 \
NUM_GEN_NODES=28 \
NUM_GYM_NODES=20 \
ENABLE_MTP_INFERENCE=1 \
CONTAINER=/path/to/nemo-rl-container \
SANDBOX_CONTAINER=/path/to/nemo-skills-sandbox.sqsh \
PERSISTENT_CACHE=/path/to/persistent/cache \
EXTRA_MOUNTS=/lustre:/lustre \
SLURM_PARTITION=$SLURM_PARTITION \
SLURM_ACCOUNT=$SLURM_ACCOUNT \
GENRM_MODEL=nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Ultra-550B-A55B-GenRM \
WANDB_API_KEY=$WANDB_API_KEY \
HF_HOME=/path/to/hf_cache \
HF_TOKEN=$HF_TOKEN \
bash examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/ultra_launch.sh
```

This is the teacher referred to as `NRL_CHAT_TEACHER1` / `NRL_RLHF_TEACHER` in
the MOPD config — it provides the `genrm_simple_agent` and
`genrm_simple_agent_reasoning_off` teacher signals.

### Reasoning Teacher

General reasoning teacher. The training data subsamples an RLVR
blend, where every prompt is graded by the `equivalence_llm_judge` agent
(LLM-judge equivalence over freeform short answers). The output checkpoint
serves the `code_gen`, `ns_tools`, `math_with_judge`,
`equivalence_llm_judge`, and `mcqa` agent slots in MOPD — one checkpoint,
many roles.

**Config:** `examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/reasoning_teacher.yaml`
- TP=8, EP=32, CP=8, PP=1 (half the expert parallelism of Student RLVR)
- `max_total_sequence_length=65536`
- `train_global_batch_size=2048`, `num_prompts_per_step=128`, `num_generations_per_prompt=16`
- Learning rate `3.0e-6` constant
- `max_num_epochs=10` — small sub-sampled dataset, multiple passes expected
- Default cluster shape: 128 nodes (64 training + 54 vLLM + 10 Gym)

### SWE Teacher

Software-engineering RLVR teacher trained against code execution. The
`swe_agents` agent runs the policy's candidate fixes inside apptainer (`.sif`)
container images for each SWE-Gym / SWE-rebench-V2 instance and rewards
the rollout based on test pass/fail.

**Config:** `examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/swe_teacher.yaml`
- TP=8, EP=32, CP=32, PP=1 (large CP for long context)
- `max_total_sequence_length=196608` (192k context)
- `train_global_batch_size=512`, `num_prompts_per_step=32`, `num_generations_per_prompt=16`
- Learning rate `3.0e-6` constant, advantage clip ±100, `max_num_epochs=4`
- Default cluster shape: 128 nodes (64 training + 64 vLLM + 0 Gym)

### Building the SIF images

Each rollout runs inside a per-instance apptainer (`.sif`) image resolved from
`${SIF_DIR}` via the agent's `container_formatter`. Since this recipe targets
GB200 (aarch64) and the upstream SWE images ship for x86 only, the images must
be rebuilt for ARM — one per instance — then converted to `.sif`. The resulting
directory is reused across runs.

The released SWE blend draws from two benchmarks:

| Benchmark | HF dataset | `.sif` path under `${SIF_DIR}` | Instances |
|---|---|---|---|
| SWE-Gym | `SWE-Gym/SWE-Gym` | `swegym/sweb.eval.arm64.{instance_id}.sif` | 206 |
| SWE-rebench-V2 | `nebius/SWE-rebench-V2` | `swerebench/{instance_id}.sif` | 7,610 |

**1. Prerequisites.** Docker, Apptainer, and `uv` on the build host. Build on an
ARM64 (GB200) node so images are natively aarch64 with no emulation. You also
need a container **registry** to publish to: set `REGISTRY` to its endpoint and
`docker login` to it first. The build scripts push every per-instance image
there, and the conversion step (3) pulls them back to produce the `.sif` files —
so the registry must be reachable from both the build and the convert hosts.

Install Apptainer on the build host via the official PPA, pinned to the version
the training container ships (so the `.sif` format matches — see
`docker/install_apptainer.sh`):

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:apptainer/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y "apptainer=1.5.0-2-1~$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")"
```

> **Storage.** The registry accumulates ~7,800 images, plus the converted `.sif`
> set on the build host. The pushed images can be deleted once every `.sif` has
> been built.

**2. Build the per-instance images.**
```bash
git clone -b ultra-v3 https://github.com/nujoug/swe-gym-arm-build
git clone -b ultra-v3 https://github.com/nujoug/swe-rebench-v2-arm-build
export REGISTRY=registry.example.com/ultra-swe   # your registry endpoint (docker login first)

# --- SWE-Gym (206 images) ---
# No verify gate: this wrapper builds + pushes only. After it finishes, drop any
# instance listed under handoff/failed_instances/ before using the images.
cd swe-gym-arm-build
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate && uv pip install -e .
python scripts/batch_build_push.py \
  --dataset SWE-Gym/SWE-Gym --split train \
  --instance_ids_file swe_gym_instance_ids.txt \
  --registry "${REGISTRY}/swe-gym" --push_env_images \
  --max_workers 8 --state_file build_push_state.json
deactivate; cd ..

# --- SWE-rebench-V2 (7,610 images) ---
# Omitting --skip-eval enables the verify gate: each image is built, the gold
# patch is applied, the tests are run, and only images whose FAIL_TO_PASS /
# PASS_TO_PASS transition matches are published (others land in
# handoff/failed_instances/).
cd swe-rebench-v2-arm-build
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate && uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# Build the per-language base images first (Go/Java/Rust/Python/… environments
# that the instance images layer on top of).
# Note: expect one known failure when building scala_base (its Dockerfile runs `foundryup`, which 403s on the GitHub API).
python3 scripts/build_all_arm_bases.py --platform linux/arm64 --keep-going --max-workers 4 --skip-existing
python3 scripts/prepare_ready_tasks.py --hf-dataset nebius/SWE-rebench-V2 --output ready_tasks.json
python3 scripts/build_eval_cleanup.py \
  --json ready_tasks.json --platform linux/arm64 --max-workers 8 \
  --report-json eval_report.json --skip-done \
  --gitlab-registry "${REGISTRY}/swerebenchv2"
deactivate; cd ..
```

**3. Convert to `.sif` and lay out `${SIF_DIR}`.** `build_swe_sif_images.py` pulls
each published image and runs `apptainer build` under the exact filename the
recipe expects — SWE-Gym from the `swe-gym:sweb.eval.arm64.<id>` tags, and
SWE-rebench-V2 from the verified (`passed_match`) instances in `eval_report.json`.
It skips images already converted and continues past any that are missing (e.g.
instances that failed to build), recording them in `${SIF_DIR}/missing_instances.txt`.
Run it from the NeMo RL repo root:
```bash
export SIF_DIR=/path/to/sif/images
python examples/nemo_gym/build_swe_sif_images.py \
  --registry "${REGISTRY}" --sif-dir "${SIF_DIR}" \
  --swe-gym-ids /path/to/swe-gym-arm-build/swe_gym_instance_ids.txt \
  --rebench-report /path/to/swe-rebench-v2-arm-build/eval_report.json
```

With `${SIF_DIR}` populated, launch the SWE teacher:

```bash
EXP_NAME=ultra-swe-teacher \
CONFIG_PATH=examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/swe_teacher.yaml \
ENABLE_MTP_INFERENCE=1 \

bash examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/ultra_launch.sh
```

## Stage 3 — MOPD

Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation. The Student RLVR output is the student; each
Gym agent is routed to one of the Stage 2 teacher checkpoints. Trains the
student to match per-agent teacher distributions.

**Config:** `examples/nemo_gym/nemotron-3-ultra/mopd.yaml`
- TP=8, EP=64, CP=32, PP=1, max context 192k
- Teacher parallelism: TP=8, CP=2, EP=16, 4 nodes per teacher
- Routing: agent → teacher checkpoint baked into the YAML via
  `${_teachers.<role>}` references; only `_teachers.general` is required and
  every other slot falls back to it.
- Default cluster shape: 224 nodes (64 training + 128 vLLM + 12 Gym + 20 teachers).

### Teacher mapping

| Logical slot | Path source | MOPD agents it serves |
|---|---|---|
| `general` | Student RLVR output | `lc_judge_simple_agent`, fallback for unset slots below |
| `rlhf` | RLHF Teacher | `genrm_simple_agent`, `genrm_simple_agent_reasoning_off` |
| `ifbench` | IFBench Teacher | `instruction_following_simple_agent`, `abstention_simple_agent`, `multichallenge_simple_agent` |
| `reasoning` | Reasoning Teacher | `math_with_judge_simple_agent`, `equivalence_llm_judge_simple_agent`, `mcqa_simple_agent`, `ns_tools_simple_agent`, `code_gen_simple_agent` |
| `swe` | SWE Teacher | all `swe_pivot_*`, `terminal_multi_harness_{opencode,agent006,codex}`, `droid_pivot_*`, `structured_outputs_v3_simple_agent`, `freeform_formatting_simple_agent`, `citation_format_simple_agent` |

### Launch

Pass `STAGE_TYPE=mopd` to the launcher to enable the teacher-pool node math
and the `_teachers.X` Hydra overrides. `NRL_GENERAL_TEACHER_PATH` is required;
the other four teacher paths are optional and fall back to general when
unset.
