# Model Guides

Model-family guidance for post-training with NeMo RL. Each family hub links to
version-specific pages covering recipe selection, recommended generation settings,
and known issues. Recipe YAML files under `examples/configs/recipes/` remain the source of
truth; these pages explain *when and why* to choose a recipe.

For the full list of supported models, see
[Model Support](../../about/model-support.md).

## Families

- **[Nemotron](nemotron/index.md)** — post-training recipes for Nemotron 3
  Nano, Nano Omni, Super, Ultra, and Nemotron 3.5 Lightning, spanning the
  Megatron and AutoModel backends.
- **[Qwen](qwen/index.md)** — Qwen3.5 LLM and VLM recipes (dense and MoE) on the
  Megatron and AutoModel backends, including thinking-mode generation-length
  guidance.

Other model-specific guides currently live directly under
[Guides](../../index.md) (for example, [DeepSeek](../deepseek.md)) and are
migrated into this hub as their guidance grows.
